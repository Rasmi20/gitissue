It's expecting Sprint data in the form of a raw toString due to how the api was returning the value. The Hygieia code works around this by attempting to reverse enginer that toString. If you are on a new version perhaps that bug has finally been fixed and it is correctly returning json.

Example:

[],"Looking to see if anyone thinks this would be useful. Right now the only way to get code quality data is with sonar. I've investigated and it seems that Jenkins has endpoints that can be hit to obtain junit, jacoco, findbugs, pmd, and checkstyle data with plugins. This would be used to populate a bunch of the code quality data. There is nothing for security analysis, technical debt, or ""functional tests"".

This would allow users to use the codequality widget without relying on sonar. It would be a Jenkins specific implementation.

282013750 @avadhmr 2.0.5 supports Jenkins pipeline jobs, 2.0.4 does not. Your task is running as per the cron you have set. 0/5 min depending on how long a run takes. If you are trying to compare run times between 2.0.5 and 2.0.4, you need to make sure and empty your database so its a true comparison and not a delta. satishc1
282138560 @satishc1 both 2.0.5 and 2.0.4 are running on separate machines so I believe its a true comparison.
We are not running any pipeline jobs in our Jenkins so I don't think both the versions should take different times to collect the same data.

The major concern here is with 2.0.5, the collector is making insane amount of requests to the Production LDAP Server and thereby overloading it. Our LDAP team has requested us not to run the process because of it and hence we had to shut down the collector. This was not happening with 2.0.4 and only started with 2.0.5, that's why I think there is some issue with the recent changes done in it.
 avadhmr
282138677 Can we please reopen this as I think it still needs some investigation? avadhmr
282145426 @avadhmr Do you guys use a lot of folders / sub-folders in your jenkins job configs ? satishc1
282155441 @satishc1 -  yes there are good amount of folder/sub-folders in Jenkins.
But as I said , it works without any issues for 2.0.4 avadhmr
283828043 Any thoughts on this?
We are blocked and unable to use jenkins collector since this issue. avadhmr
283959985 I have also experienced terrible Jenkins API performance with Jenkins instances that are very large (10,000 jobs). I have not determined the root cause yet. It seems random - sometimes rest calls finish in a minute or so and sometimes they take an hour. For me it has happened with the old Hygieia instances as well. We added paging to the jenkins collector (#922) but that didn't resolve the issue. MarkRx
283970843 @avadhmr @MarkRx @tabladrum Haven't had time to look into this .. as per @avadhmr  ""The major concern here is with 2.0.5, the collector is making insane amount of requests to the Production LDAP Server and thereby overloading it.""

@avadhmr Any chance you can run it in debug mode ""once"" and upload the log ?
 satishc1

284721040 Are you using apiKeys? If you are using username and password then each rest call will require a login which requires verification with the LDAP server. If using api keys the api rest calls will not need to hit LDAP. MarkRx

- improve environment logging when a commit is not found (specify which environment)
- All commits vs bounded commits
- case sensitivity of component names vs artifact names
- Bug: the last commit in a graph is currently bound but we are adding their parent revision numbers into the commit graph. This results in an additional commit that we don't have knowledge of
- where does average of 35D come from for helloworld? MarkRx
282639717 I have debugged the dynamicPipeline feature, now I know how to produce pipeline stages data and how to show them.
(1). How to produce build stage data.
This feature will get only SCM info of the last build for one commit, then store it to the build stage. Why it don't collect all the build SCM info for one commit ?
(2). How to show commit stage data.
When get commit stage data from database, this feature will check build stage data first, if build stage data's scmRevisionNumber is same to commit stage data, commit stage data will be ignored and can't be shown. In my CI process, one commit automaticlly trigger one build, there will not be commit which has not been built, so the commit stage will always be blank, it can't show the average time of all the commits. 
I think don't ignore the commit data which have same scmRevisionNumber with build stage data is a better choice.

I have checked the code, and found the root cause, if build stage data's scmRevisionNumber is same to commit stage data, commit stage data can't be shown. so the commit stage will always be blank, it can't show the average time of all the commits. If I want to see the average time of commits, how to do it? wdquan1985
283085407 Yes I think that is the way the product view works right now (note it works they way regardless of the state of that feature switch). I agree that metrics should still show up even if no commits are in that exact stage. MarkRx
280577321 I have read the code, build stage data will be created only when the build info be saved to database, and this build stage data only belongs to one team level dashboard, the same to other stages. So if I create another team level dashboard, and import the same build data, build stage data will not be created for this new team level dashboard, because the build data will not be saved to database again.

And I know if there is new build info, it will be saved to build stage of the new team dashboard pipeline, but the past build info will not.

- improve environment logging when a commit is not found (specify which environment)
- All commits vs bounded commits
- case sensitivity of component names vs artifact names

282639717 I have debugged the dynamicPipeline feature, now I know how to produce pipeline stages data and how to show them.
(1). How to produce build stage data.
This feature will get only SCM info of the last build for one commit, then store it to the build stage. Why it don't collect all the build SCM info for one commit ?
(2). How to show commit stage data.
When get commit stage data from database, this feature will check build stage data first, if build stage data's scmRevisionNumber is same to commit stage data, commit stage data will be ignored and can't be shown. In my CI process, one commit automaticlly trigger one build, there will not be commit which has not been built, so the commit stage will always be blank, it can't show the average time of all the commits. 
I think don't ignore the commit data which have same scmRevisionNumber with build stage data is a better choice.

282716895 You can't fill the SCM data from the build because not all of the necessary fields are available from the build collectors. That is why they are looked up. MarkRx
282977062  About the pipeline commit stage data.
 There are commit stage data in the database.
![pipedata](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/23397568/0b9d53f8-fdd4-11e6-81c2-99a2abb67a5d.png)
But the commit stage data can't be shown in the dashboard.
![commitnotshow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/23397609/3aa678aa-fdd4-11e6-8a85-65ad8834ebea.png)
I have checked the code, and found the root cause, if build stage data's scmRevisionNumber is same to commit stage data, commit stage data can't be shown. so the commit stage will always be blank, it can't show the average time of all the commits. If I want to see the average time of commits, how to do it? wdquan1985
283085407 Yes I think that is the way the product view works right now (note it works they way regardless of the state of that feature switch). I agree that metrics should still show up even if no commits are in that exact stage. MarkRx

Anything wrong with my configuration? tinabear
279890114 @tinabear The code currently uses the TEMPO_TEAMS_REST_SUFFIX when you set feature.jiraTeamFieldName . Since you don't have tempo teams, hence the error when trying to invoke https://jira.xxxxxx.com/rest/tempo-teams/1/team . Can you find out the rest url for your team info and a sample json that is returned ? satishc1
280014868 The code does not support alternative mechanisms to representing teams outside of the tempo-team plugin at this time. The teamQuery setting does not appear to be used. MarkRx
280101219 @MarkRx So I cannot change anything to make the collector show team info outside of the tempo-team plugin, can I? Any further plan for this issue?

Thank you tinabear
280655532 Correct. My team had discussed the idea of allowing arbitrary queries into the feature collection but we decided against it due to the complexity of having to support a query DSL. It would also require the collectors to have knowledge and be able to pull in arbitrary fields from the json response.

I do not have any plans to implement being able to support non-standard fields for teams. MarkRx

When I run the Bitbucket collector it is automatically embedding ""projects/repo"" in middle of the URL, so I am getting 404 URL not found error.

- The issues have not been updated past your cutoff date in your properties

- You are missing statuses MarkRx

Not sure what filters(for point 2) are you referring to here, can you please give an example? avadhmr
280475598 Check your database in the feature collection. You can use a tool like robomongo. Find the id of a bug that you expect to show up and see if it is found in the database.

By filters I meant scrum vs kanban, team, and project. It's right in the UI. MarkRx

279231068 What is your deployment tool? tabladrum
279390874 Urbancode deploy shilpsl1
283141546 @shilpsl1  - update to latest code and try out below steps 

1) configure build widget, repo widget and deploy widget  and run collectors.
2) Configure pipeline with customized names for all environments deployed.
3) add team dashboard to product dashboard. 
Product dashboard should display COMMIT, BUILD and configured stages.

283171499 @nireeshT 
Tried by using latest code,
1. I got the error : PhantomJS not found on PATH
    So I copied old code Hygieia/UI/node_modules folder to new code. Then build was success.
2. I followed the the above 3 steps
    But I donot see anything in Product dashboard. Jenkins and gitlab is also configured.
    Also even though deployment was success it is showing failure.

[],"As mentioned in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1137

I followed all the steps but still Jira does not show any data. Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well? 

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
""name"" : ""Jira"",
""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
""enabled"" : true,
""online"" : true,
""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show Jira as an option).

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

Don't change AgileTool to ScopeOwner.   Clear your browser cache after step 4 you've listed above and see if that helps. satishc1

279004734 @anandsit Yes rebuild all your modules. If you are ever in doubt as to which modules need to be built, you can look at the list of files changed in a PR. satishc1
279031546 Set feature.jiraTeamFieldName to the empty string or remove it from your properties. MarkRx
279041523 as a general practice, it is okay to rebuild.

but in this case, will the rebuild resolve the issue ? anandsit
279043444 @MarkRx  - Let me know the right value in DB. Is it ScopeOwner or AgileTool ?

} anandsit
279052900 It should be AgileTool. ScopeOwner was the old one that was renamed to AgileTool. MarkRx
279057230 @MarkRx  - when it is AgileTool, the Dropdown does not list Jira as an option. 

In that case, i need to update from API and UI components as well. Because Api is still old and probably looking for ScopeOwner in DB. anandsit

279031046 The issue is something else but it looks like a bug in the error handling is causing it to get lost. According to the doc e.getStatusCode returns an Optional. I think you need to change the code to this:

```
if (e.getStatusCode().isPresent() && e.getStatusCode().get() == 401 ) {
					LOGGER.error(""Error 401 connecting to JIRA server, your credentials are probably wrong. Note: Ensure you are using JIRA user name not your email address."");

[],"Hi,

I am working on a POC for Jenkins Cucumber Reports. I have a local jenkins setup with a job that generates cucumber reports. I am trying to the publish those results on hygieia dashboard. But I am getting the below authentication error. I am not sure if it is a proxy error or something else. I am not sure if I am missing anything in the process. I have a demo soon, can anyone please help. Thank you.

The below is how I have set my jenkins job

Invoke Gradle Script

                    -Dcucumber.options=""--tags @healthcheck""

279053786 @kavitha0624 Your log looks correct after the file name pattern change. You should be able to click ""+"" under Functional Tests on the quality widget and your job should show up in the dropdown. If it doesn't , check your Global hygieia publisher settings to see which api url you are pointed to. Your dashboard UI needs to be pulling from the same api. satishc1
279068817 **Thank you a bunch @satishc1** It worked now. I am able to see the details.

On the widget under functional tests header, I see like this 	DDX-IWS	71%	 7m (what does these values indicate?)

In the popup when I click on the functional test details (on widget), I am seeing this in the top --
Run# 857      Feb 10,      13:52:09Duration: 6m 33s  View Test Job 
/output	91	65	0 **(what are these numbers related to?)**

Also, in Hygieia plugin, I have given the environment name too, where will that appear on the widget? kavitha0624
279430484 @kavitha0624 Good to know its working. The numbers on the test details are from your cucumber json. Look at testdetails.html in the widgets/codeanalysis to see what the fields are.

The ""Application Name"" and ""Environment Name"" that you entered in your Testjob in Jenkins are not being used in the functional tests UI currently.  You can ""Name"" the test in the UI using the + button and call it something similar to correlate them.  In the future we will use the App Name and Env Name and tie it to the product dashboard. satishc1

278998408 @kavitha0624 If your test results file is on the jenkins server, you could create a JenkinsTestResults job and push the file to hygieia using the publisher plugin. Is that what you are trying to achieve in your POC ? You don't need any jenkins-cucumber properties if you go this route.

For your sonar collector error, you need to import your cert into the jvm that's running the sonar collector.  satishc1
279009239 Hi Satish, thank you so much for replying. I have tried publishing from jenkins using the hygieia plugin. I am using my company's jenkins job now.. which produces cucumber reports. Just like the above I have configured this jenkins job too. The below is the output I see. Everything seems to be fine but I am not seeing any option in the dropdown under functional tests on hygieia sonar's widget. Please help. Let me know if I need to provide any more details for you. Your support is much appreciated. Thanks.

I have crosschecked that the file cucumber.json is present here on the server where this job ran - /opt/jenkins/workspace/pymtsrv-org/ddx/DDX-IWS/ddx-iws-acceptance-tests-dev/output

* Tried to achieve same look and feel for links as in other places in application.

[],"Using Hygieia as one tool across your enterprise for single view into your env, you can measure your progress for SDLC for your projects projects hosted on GIT. Metrics for Pulls and Issues can be added to the commits graph to show how the Pull Requests( code contributions) and Issues (ideas that help shape your project) are flowing in - and counts of developers committing, requesting a Pull and creating issues - would help us understand how popular your repo is.

Once the collector runs scanning GIT for all Pulls and Issues along with Commits as it does currently, it leaves the entries for the developers LOB/Department heads etc as TBD items so you can implement a local collector for your enterprise that scans for these and updates the fields by accessing your “HR” data sources.

Code changes required would include API, githubcollector and UI.

Please help me on this issue @satishc1 @tabladrum @amitmawkin Clement06
278335174 @Clement06 Does the maven log have any connect or timeout errors ? Also try running mvn clean install from the Hygieia folder in a network not restricted by proxy. satishc1
278797157 @satishc1 
Hi Sathish, thanks for your timely reply.

[],"We found a bug in the gitlab collector that would stop you from being able to get commits if the collector ran for a repo, but the collector was misconfigured.  What would happen is the collector would have a bad configuration that didn't allow you to retrieve commits from git.  If someone then created a Gitlab repo in a dashboard, the collector would run, retrieve no commits, and set the last updated to the current time.  The ""first run"" would have been run already.  Then, when the configuration was fixed, the collector would have already done the first run, so it would only try to retrieve commits from the ""last update"" time, back 10 minutes.  Therefor never retrieving the commits from whatever value was specified for first run.  This change prevents updating the ""last update"" time on a repo unless there was a successful request made to gitlab.  Any HttpClientErrorException or ResourceAccessException will prevent the ""last update"" time from changing, which means, a newly configured repo will get it's first run again, and other repos will get all commits from the last successful run.

***Commits have been squashed for convenience.***

* The create dashboard modal has been expanded to allow selection of widgets from all 3 panes (1 below). 
* Update modal has been added to reselect which widgets the owner/admin wants to display (2 below).
* Configure icon has been added next to pane button set to allow for updates. This window can be expanded later to support extra dashboard specific configurations (3 below).
* Update is only available to owner/admin.
* Preexisting dashboards start with all widgets selected to support backwards compatibility, extraneous widgets can be removed by owner/admin.
* If no widgets are selected to be shown for a given pane, a helpful message appears explaining to any users wondering why no widgets are displayed.
* Template variable has been **removed** from the dashboard object, dashboard now maintains a map of available widget types and the panes where those widgets will be found.
* All template views have been consolidated into one single 'team.html/js' view. 

**Note** This PR allows users to select which widgets are displayed, it does not allow for multiple widgets of the same type. IE, having 2 Repository widgets is not supported.

[],"As we rollout Hygieia throughout our organization, we find ourselves having to update property files to account for Jenkins or Sonar servers to pull data from, and restart corresponding applications. 

This enhancement enables maintaining this list of servers in a git repository (external from the application) and have Hygieia always pull the latest list of servers in every run without having to do any restart.

I do know there are other collectors that could take advantage of the collector-config-server. I first want to see if there's interest in this enhancement. If so, I could either apply it to the other collectors or have the community consume the collector-config-server as needed.

"
[],"Jira and VersionOne refactoring in terms of making it uniform and also matching the overall design pattern of the rest of Hygieia.

1. Do not create any collector item from either VersionOne or Jira collector. Only create team and/or scope documents.
2. UI drop downs fetches data from scope (for Project drop down) and team (for team drop down)
3. Once UI config is saved, create a CollectorItem with the combination configured. The collector item will have the project and team selected on the UI. One of these has to be present, both can't be null (error validation on UI)
4. Jira collector and VersionOne collector collects feature data based on the project+team in the collector item collection. This can potentially save a lot of time in data collection too. (NOTE: This one is not included in this PR, it will be done in the future).
5. View options (such as Scrum or Kanban, Points or Count or Hours etc) are as usual saved in widget config options.

Steps to re-run the jira / versionone collectors once the PR is merged:

1. Make a backup of your database.
2. delete collector_items where collectorId in (select collectors.id from collectors where collectors.name in (""Jira"", ""VersionOne"") )
3. delete collectors where collectorType in (""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner"") 
4. Drop feature , scope , team
5. Build and install latest codebase for UI / core / api / collector.
6. Run UI, api, jira and versionone collector.
7. Clear your browser cache. Open your dashboard and re-configure your feature widget to pick the right project / team value.

Script for Steps 2, 3 and 4 is given below.

```
db.collectors.find({
	""name"" : { $in : [""Jira"", ""VersionOne""] }   
}).forEach(
	function(myDoc) {
		print('Dropping collector_items where collectorId is ' + myDoc._id);
		db.collector_items.remove( {""collectorId"" : myDoc._id} );
	}
);

print('Dropping collectors where collectorType in Feature, Scope, ScopeOwner');
db.collectors.remove({ ""collectorType"" : { $in : [""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner""] } });

print('Dropping feature collection');
db.feature.drop();

print('Dropping scope collection');
db.scope.drop();

print('Dropping team collection');
db.team.drop();
```",204312571,1137,Jira and VersionOne refactoring,2017-01-31 14:25:04,2018-09-18 14:38:57,closed,14,satishc1,"276796284 @MarkRx Good to know its working well. Running Step 5 creates the AgileTool collectors. satishc1
276954804 Yes. I intentionally did not clean up any data because that is what the vast majority of users are going to do when upgrading. I wanted to experience what they would encounter. MarkRx
277068074 It is working now after I changed feature.jiraIssueTypeId to feature.jiraIssueTypeNames in conf. tinabear
277302393 To @MarkRx 's point, I was looking through the code yesterday, and it seems like saving of the collector information doesn't work as intended.  When changes are made to properties of a collector, such as the ""collectorType"", they are overwritten by their previous value before being saved.  I was going to open an issue on that since I wasn't sure if that was intentional, or a bug.  

This can be seen on line 55 in this file: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/CollectorTask.java

It looks like it should probably keep the ""id"" from the old collector, but allow the other properties to be updated.  

 rob-miller-777
278528049 Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well.

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
    ""name"" : ""Jira"",
    ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
    ""enabled"" : true,
    ""online"" : true,
    ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show  Jira as an option). 

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

276544262 @MarkRx @tabladrum Edited cleanup steps to add this line below. Please try it out and let us know if the exception is resolved.
db.collectors.remove({   ""collectorType"" : { $in : [""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner""] }   }); satishc1
276661222 That will work, but are you prepared to handle all of the jira issues that are raised due to collectors breaking on an upgrade? Is there harm in just letting the stale records linger? MarkRx
276662383 I think we are going to put those back as deprecated. And take it out at a later date. @satishc1 is updating the PR. tabladrum
276677281 @MarkRx @tabladrum Added the deprecated collector types and committed. Will take these out at a later date. satishc1
276711907 Will test this afternoon. MarkRx
276777008 Nothing shows up under the ""Agile Content Tool Type:"" dropdown.

Looks like CollectorTask.java is just reading in and saving the existing collector by name (""Jira""). It never updates the collectorType from ScopeOwner to AgileTool.

I manually changed it in my database. Other than that it seems to be working good. Thanks. MarkRx
276792643 @MarkRx Did you do ""Step 5. Run jira and versionone collector""  after cleaning up the collections ? satishc1
276796284 @MarkRx Good to know its working well. Running Step 5 creates the AgileTool collectors. satishc1
276954804 Yes. I intentionally did not clean up any data because that is what the vast majority of users are going to do when upgrading. I wanted to experience what they would encounter. MarkRx
277068074 It is working now after I changed feature.jiraIssueTypeId to feature.jiraIssueTypeNames in conf. tinabear
277302393 To @MarkRx 's point, I was looking through the code yesterday, and it seems like saving of the collector information doesn't work as intended.  When changes are made to properties of a collector, such as the ""collectorType"", they are overwritten by their previous value before being saved.  I was going to open an issue on that since I wasn't sure if that was intentional, or a bug.  

This can be seen on line 55 in this file: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/CollectorTask.java

It looks like it should probably keep the ""id"" from the old collector, but allow the other properties to be updated.  

 rob-miller-777
278528049 Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well.

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
    ""name"" : ""Jira"",
    ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
    ""enabled"" : true,
    ""online"" : true,
    ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show  Jira as an option). 

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

[],"I'm having problems getting the frontend and API talking due to the password.

Master API contains:

[centos@devopsmetrics0 Hygieia]$ more api/target/classes/application.properties
dbname=dashboarddb
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=ENC(C9PLVDJ/1OfkT/3jvC/wEB20R1XPJtg9)

But the documentation says to setup Mongo with db / dbpass as the user.

I've tried reverse engineering the encrypted password, or setting a new password in Mongo, but the Java stuff for creating an encrypted password hangs.

Any clear steps on how to get the two talking, or can we update the repo so it's easier to get started?

276392175 @benjaminwootton you could also just pass an environment variable called JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD if you dont want to update your Dockerfile. The command would be : docker run -t -p 8080:8080 -v ./logs:/hygieia/logs -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=127.0.0.1"" -e ""JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=hygieiasecret"" -i hygieia-api:latest Mpluya

I think because JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_SECRET is not set.  There isnt much mention of this in the docs either.

[],"Hi Satish,

The solution given to https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1131 did not work. Hence creating a new issue since #1131 was closed.

This is what I did:

1. Stopped the collector.
2. Updated the existing dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
3. Performed a commit - but it was not picked up by the collector.
4. Stopped the collector.
5. Created a new dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
6. It picked up the commit performed in step#3 above.
7. Performed a new commit - but again this was not picked up by the collector.

[],"Hi,

Have compiled the code as of 28-Jan-2017. The api, github,gulp serve collector are running without any error. Have configured the code report widget. And the widget shows the code commited today before the widget was configured. The collector also seems to be running fine at 5 min intervals as per the output below:

The problem is if I do a commit to the repo - the collector fails to capture that and hence is not displayed in the dashboard.

If I create a new dashboard with the same repo details - it thus shows the new commit. But the first dashboard which is also pointing to the same repo shows the status as of before it was configured.

The github repo is public.

Below is my application.properties file content:

# Database Name
dbname=dashboarddb

# Database HostName - default is localhost
dbhost=localhost

# Database Port - default is 27017
dbport=27017

# MongoDB replicaset
dbreplicaset=[false if you are not using MongoDB replicaset]
dbhostport=[host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3]

# Database Username - default is blank
dbusername=admin

# Database Password - default is blank
dbpassword=admin123

# Logging File location

Please help in resolving this.

Thanks.

276416096 Sorry for a lame question @satishc1 ..but how do we run it in debug mode? rohanb3
276457759 @rohanb3 Change the log level in the logback xml file for the github collector. satishc1
282005620 @rohanb3 Reopen with debug log if still an issue. satishc1
276094788 @rohanb3 Looks like you might have saved credentials for a public repo in your widget. If your repo is public, you don't need to save the credentials. So blank them out and re-save the config in your repo widget and then run the github collector. satishc1
276116636 Hi Satish,

This is what I did:

1. Stopped the collector.
2. Updated the existing dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
3. Performed a commit - but it was not picked up by the collector.
4. Stopped the collector.
5. Created a new dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
6. It picked up the commit performed in set#3 above.
7. Performed a new commit - but again this was not picked up by the collector.

276126925 @rohanb3 I'm assuming you are not getting any errors in your collector now that you've blanked your credentials out.

Now the commits will get picked as per your desired cron setting. You've set this to 
github.cron=0 0/5 * * * *

Leave the collector running (don't keep resetting it) for a 2 hour period (and do some commits in this time period) and see how the commits get collected based on your cron setting and refer to this to change this setting. http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html

Check your collector log for the 2 hour period. You should either see errors or you should see commits fetched based on your cron setting. satishc1
276137132 Acknowledged @satishc1  rohanb3
276173475 @satishc1 ...tried as per your suggestions....but it did not work nor is the collector throwing any error. It is printing as below:

276194608 @rohanb3 Run it with debug and paste the log. satishc1
276416096 Sorry for a lame question @satishc1 ..but how do we run it in debug mode? rohanb3
276457759 @rohanb3 Change the log level in the logback xml file for the github collector. satishc1
282005620 @rohanb3 Reopen with debug log if still an issue. satishc1

[],"Hi,

Have cloned the repo today - 28-Jan-2017. Was able to compile it successfully.
Am also able to start the collectors and do gulp serve successfully. But when trying to start the api am getting the below error. Not sure if have missed anything:

api.properties file is as below:
# dashboard.properties
dbname=dashboarddb
dbusername=admin
dbpassword=admin123
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
#dbreplicaset=[false if you are not using MongoDB replicaset]
dbhostport=localhost:27017
#server.contextPath=[Web Context path if any]
server.port=8080
#version.number=@application.version.number@
key=x+PIzci6AWiPZP7HMjvySiATg2Kwv87c

Command and Error Log:

[],"Resolves #1031. This was considerably bigger than @brennanananan and I had realized going in, but we feel like we have it at a really good spot. Test it out and let us know if there are any changes you would like to see or issues we need to address.  We are anticipating plenty of questions due to the nature of the pull request and it's size. 

**What's Included**
- Implemented JWT to provide stateless authentication/authorization
- Updated angular client to work with JWT tokens
- Made token expiration configurable
- Implemented redirect functionality to take you to the page you were viewing if you token expires and the API returns a 401 status code
- Made secret key configurable to support having multiple instances of the API running
- Added Spring Security to Rest API
- Built in support for multiple forms of authentication (standard and ldap auth currently implemented)
- Refactored current login to work with Spring Security
- Created a UserInfo Repository separate from the Authentication repository to support multiple forms of authentication. This lets us control all application specific details of a user such as roles and themes independent of the authentication type. (Themes are still only handled by the angular app on the client, and saved in local storage, but this is something we can now save for a user if we want to)
- Made admin a ""role"" instead of just assigning admin privileges to the user named ""admin"". (Haven't implemented a way to assign new admins yet, so right now it works as before where the user named ""admin"" is given the role of admin, this is handled on the backend.  There is no way to give an ldap user ""admin"" privileges currently unless their name is actually ""admin"")
- Added method level security to dashboard modification controller so only owners of the dashboard or admins can modify a dashboard
- Added support for having multiple owners of a dashboard (have not created anyway to assign multiple owners yet, but shouldn't be hard to do)
- Implemented new owner functionality in such a way that it won't break backwards compatibility",203696480,1129,Spring Security/JWT Implementation,2017-01-27 17:42:15,2018-09-18 14:38:56,closed,41,rob-miller-777,"299491245 @rob-miller-777 ,Thanks for your response.Still am getting same exception.

299511566 Think your issue might be with the spaces in ""UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr"", probably has to be url encoded. Try replacing that with ""UD_DH_Nexus%20Rep%20Mgr"". rob-miller-777
299609538 @gokulknewt - Or you can try ""auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389/DC=qcorpaa,DC=aa,DC=com"", it's just a configuration issue based on your own ldap server, the hygieia code is OK. wdquan1985
299954128 @wdquan1985,

Could you please provide clear structure on auth.ldapUserDnPattern. Also to connect my Active directory i have define uname and password. how to define that.Could you please assist to us?

Here is the out dir. structure...

300034547 @gokulknewt - I want to help you but I think I had told you all the things I know. May be you can setup a simple ldap server for verifying the ldap authentication. Or you can capture the data package using tcpdump command in Linux or wireshark in windows.

Have your ldap server been used for other web system? if yes, you can capture the data package when login, then compare it with the the data package captured for hygieia login.

282372466 What's the state of this PR? Was hoping LDAP was in master by now but that does not appear to be the case. MarkRx
282386337 Haven't heard anything yet. rob-miller-777
284064305 @satishc1 lets branch this off tabladrum
287663409 I test the ldap authentication function using this branch https://github.com/StateFarmIns/Hygieia/tree/springSecurityIntegration.
I use shell script to send build info to hygieia, for example:
curl --connect-timeout 10 -m 60 -i -X POST --header ""Content-Type:application/json"" -H ""Accept:application/json"" --data
'{""artifactName"":""SANDBOX"",""canonicalName"":""SANDBOX"",""artifactGroup"":""SANDBOX"",""artifactVersion"":""1.0"",""buildId"":""timestamp"",""timestamp"":1488942038335,""sourceChangeSet"":[{""scmUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/gerrit/60730"",""scmBranch"":""1.0"",""scmRevisionNumber"":""Ica15fe4f1f9d05a3c6bf74b7c0df8191565fcf76"",""scmAuthor"":""ZHANG,Harry(Harry)"",""scmParentRevisionNumbers"":[""d61cbc08f08bb8f674c41b4f55ff6e4fd784378d""],""type"":""New"",""scmCommitTimestamp"":1488963918000,""numberOfChanges"":1}],""metadata"":{""jobName"":""SANDBOX"",""buildUrl"":""127.0.0.1/job/SANDBOX/179/"",""buildNumber"":179,""jobUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/job/SANDBOX/"",""instanceUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/""}}' -u userName:password http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/artifact .
I have send the username and password to hygieia, but there is an error:
{""timestamp"":1489558957506,""status"":401,""error"":""Unauthorized"",""message"":""Full authentication is required to access this resource"",""path"":""/api/artifact""}

Then I permit the url request which start with api by changing code in the spring security java configuration file com.capitalone.dashboard.config.WebSecurityConfig.java.
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http.headers().cacheControl();
http.csrf().disable()
.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(""/appinfo"").permitAll()
.antMatchers(""/registerUser"").permitAll()
.antMatchers(""/login**"").permitAll()
.antMatchers(""/api**"").permitAll()
.antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, ""/**"").permitAll()
.anyRequest().authenticated()
.and()
.addFilterBefore(standardLoginRequestFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
.addFilterBefore(ldapLoginRequestFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
.exceptionHandling().authenticationEntryPoint(new Http401AuthenticationEntryPoint(""Authorization""));
}.

But it still can't work, how can I configure to ignore the authentication and authorization checks?
When I send the jenkins build into to hygieia, there is no any error, but the hygieia mongo db can't search the corresponding record. wdquan1985
287664112 I add .antMatchers(""/build"",""/artifact"",""/quality/**"").permitAll(), because I use shell script to send build info, artifact info and sonarQube report to hygieia server.
I have not used the jenkins plugin. I only use shell script, is your temporary solution avilable for shell script?
For example:
curl --connect-timeout 10 -m 60 -i -X POST --header ""Content-Type:application/json"" -H ""Accept:application/json"" -u userName:password --data '{~~~~~~}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/build
If I don't add .antMatchers(""/build"",""/artifact"",""/quality/**"").permitAll(), how can I make it work ?  wdquan1985
287772769 My most recent commit should allow your shell script to send data.  It pretty much does what you were doing.  Take a look at this commit here from last week. https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1129/commits/5cb339442d1c643aa8343ceaa4b212c347473841 rob-miller-777

294420807 @rob-miller-777 same as @wdquan1985 , I met the 401 even on the latest code base:

Could you hint where am I wrong? 
I've setup api- properties as with auth.secret=hygieiasecret

As far as I suppose, there should be a header of ""Authorization: Bearer <JWT>"", the question is where I could find/create this token?
Thanks

294515482 I'm having a hard time replicating this issue.  With the code base in master, the jenkins plugin doesn't seem to have any issue for me sending requests to the api.   rob-miller-777
294515539 @wdquan1985 Are you still having this issue? rob-miller-777
294640819 @rob-miller-777 Resolved.  The code allows 'http://10.35.24.62:3002/api/deploy' but not 'http://10.35.24.62:3002/api/deploy/' . Any slash at the tail is restricted :P    xpdable
294865579 Ah, makes sense.  Think that's ok though since the jenkins plugin doesn't add the slash.   rob-miller-777
295059465 @rob-miller-777 @satishc1 Regarding the possibility of AD LDS Service on LDAP, is there an plan of that ? xpdable
295293411 I'm going to be perfectly honest and say I am not an LDAP expert, so I'm not sure what all would need to change.  However, from what little I do know, LDAP is just a protocol for querying something like active directory, so I would guess this should already be handled.  I could be misreading your question though. rob-miller-777
295509040 @rob-miller-777 Honestly, I am not either but we'd like to integrate enterprise level authorization with that.
Let me explain a little more with the Jenkins setting. 
Our AD LDS is required a Manger DN and password for any user to login where I toggled in yellow background. Now for Hygieia setting I could only see the setting for the red underline part of user.
So questions is where I should put my Manager DN, etc...
Correct me if I am doing wrong in Hygieia API properties file :)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2903719/25207677/dce7f0bc-25a2-11e7-8fba-0a8f3d63ed97.png)

295559351 @xpdable, @rob-miller-777  - My ldap server info is as following:
% ldapsearch \
-xLLL \
-h ************************.com \
-p 3000 \
-b ""dc=Internal,dc=Users,dc=Bruce"" \
""uid=bruce"" \
uid displayName mail businessTitle JobFamily telephoneNumber mobile

dn: polarisuid=bruce,dc=Internal, dc=Users, dc=Bruce
uid: bruce
displayName: ******************
mail: ************************
businessTitle: ******************
JobFamily: ***********************
telephoneNumber: ***************
mobile: *********************



And I configure ldap for hygieia as following:
auth.expirationTime=
auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://*******************.com:3791/dc=internal,dc=users,dc=Bruce
auth.ldapUserDnPattern=polarisuid={0}

Then ldap authenticaition can work. wdquan1985
295760073 With how it's implemented currently, there is no way to get the manager dn and password through, however, it should be a pretty trivial change to make this happen.  I am currently working on letting Hygieia utilize ldap groups to determine admin access, so I could include the ability to pass through more ldap settings such as manager dn. rob-miller-777
295760385 Is it not working for you with just those two settings available to you? rob-miller-777
295772259 @rob-miller-777 @xpdable @wdquan1985 We will be merging a PR for ActiveDirectory support. satishc1
296000016 @rob-miller-777 problem is... 100 percent sure I need the Manager login to use our AD LDS,  therefore I am not sure where to set the password in those two settings even I could set DN after the ldaps url as @wdquan1985 does :sob: 

@wdquan1985 Have you even try some login with a admin and password in the config?

@satishc1  Thanks, anyway looks forward the AD support with manager credential  xpdable
296003404 @xpdable - You don't need to set password in those two settings, you just need to enter you username and password in the login page.
![login](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/25258824/bce2ab68-2674-11e7-89fe-5329923488f0.png)
 wdquan1985
296206186 I believe it has to do with how it's configured.  I have a pull request I am going to open soon that allows you to set the manager dn and password.  It will also let you use an ldap group to select admins.   rob-miller-777
297746812 @wdquan1985,Team

We are going to implement the spring LDAP security for dashboard login page.Could you please provide me the steps and implementation.It would be much helpful!!

The following is my whole configuration including ldap in the application.properties file.

You need to configure ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern="" according to your own ldap configuration, it maybe ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern=polarisuid={0}"" or ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0}"" or others. wdquan1985
298633161 **@wdquan198**5-Thanks for your detailed info.Although,we have few clarifications.Can you please demonstrate on this.
**Q1#**There is seems to be u didn't define the LDAP username and password from applcation.properties file.Does it require to connect uname and pword?
**Q2#** auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://*******************.com:3791/dc=internal,dc=users,dc=Bruce. 
       Can we use   tls 1.0 protocol instead of ldap protocols.
**Q3#** To authenticate the only admin user only can authenticate  others user also can we do the autnticate while entering login page.

Regards,
Gokul k

 gokulknewt
298806077 @gokulknewt - Q1# we don't need uname and pword in the application.properties file, because the uname and password will be captured in the login page where you try to login.
Q2# spring security framework supports ldap authentication, but I don't know if it support tls 1.0 authentication, you can search spring security materials to identify it.
Q3# I have used a commen user not admin user to authenticate, and it was successfull.

You can learn more about the whole process of ldap authentication. wdquan1985
299436131 @wdquan1985,
we have tried to connect active directory,but while run the api.jar itself we are getting exception.Could you please let me know the configuration whether we configure right approach or not

 gokulknewt
299484237 Try something more like this, 
`auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389`
`auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0},ou=UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr,ou=Applications,ou=Groups,dc=qcorpaa,dc=aa,dc=com`

I'm not sure about the user dn pattern, you need the dn pattern to your users. And I don't know what yours would be. rob-miller-777
299491245 @rob-miller-777 ,Thanks for your response.Still am getting same exception.
When am try to run the api.jar am getting exception.For that can you provide me the right direction.

Thanks,
Gokul k

 gokulknewt
299511566 Think your issue might be with the spaces in ""UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr"", probably has to be url encoded. Try replacing that with ""UD_DH_Nexus%20Rep%20Mgr"". rob-miller-777
299609538 @gokulknewt - Or you can try ""auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389/DC=qcorpaa,DC=aa,DC=com"", it's just a configuration issue based on your own ldap server, the hygieia code is OK. wdquan1985
299954128 @wdquan1985,

Could you please provide clear structure on auth.ldapUserDnPattern. Also to connect my Active directory i have define uname and password. how to define that.Could you please assist to us?

Here is the out dir. structure...

Regards,
Gokul k


 gokulknewt
300034547 @gokulknewt - I want to help you but I think I had told you all the things I know. May be you can setup a simple ldap server for verifying the ldap authentication. Or you can capture the data package using tcpdump command in Linux or wireshark in windows.

Have your ldap server been used for other web system? if yes, you can capture the data package when login, then compare it with the the data package captured for hygieia login.

[],"I am hoping someone can me out.  I think I am missing something very basic.  

I have Hygieia set up on a system and can run each piece correctly using the gulp
serve.  This means the API comes and connects to mongod and the UI launches under
gulp and I can access the dashboard through the UI interface.   I have been asked to
get the UI up under Tomcat rather than gulp serve.  To do this I set up Tomcat on the
same system, changed the port to 8090 so it did not conflict with the API Tomcat instance
and then moved the UI dist folder under the Tomcat webapps folder (and renamed it to
Hygieia).  Now, if I access Tomcat on that system and tell it specifically to bring up Hygieia .....
                                        localhost:8090/Hygieia
the login page appears but the API Connectivity shows no connection.

I have seen that in the gulpfile.js file, a proxy is set up to point to localhost:8080 where the 
instance of the API Tomcat would be.  I thought that is what I need to add to the start up of 
my instance of Tomcat but so far everything I have tried (adding proxy elements to both the
catalina.sh and to the JAVA_OPT in the catalina.properties files) does not work. 

I have looked through numerous other posts to try and find nuggets that I might be able
to look into to help me crack this nut - one post asked the submitter for the UI log files.  I
have not been able to find these on my system and I am pretty sure they might provide
some insight.

At this point I am thinking I am making this much more difficult than it has to be.  Any help
that anyone might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.",203253275,1127,Problems getting Hygieia UI under Tomcat to connect to API,2017-01-25 23:27:08,2018-09-18 14:38:56,closed,9,amayesthing,"275782796 @amayesthing 

You are welcome! Here it is..

1. Build the Hygieia API project as a WAR artifact instead of JAR. i.e, Change the packaging to war in API project pom.xml, like below:
`<packaging>war</packaging>`
and re-build the API project.

2. Deploy the api*.war file in Tomcat.

3. Hygieia API requires the ""dashboard.properties"" file for MongoDB connectivity. To set this up with in Tomcat container, do the following:
       - Add a CATALINA_OPTS variable in Catalina.bat (or. sh under Linux) file like below (update the path based on your environment):
         `set CATALINA_OPTS=""-Dspring.config.location=file:C:\DevOps\HygieiaApi\dashboard.properties""`

   Note : I added the above variable right below this line:
           :java_dir_displayed
           echo Using CLASSPATH:       ""%CLASSPATH%""
           set CATALINA_OPTS=""-Dspring.config.location=file:C:\DevOps\HygieiaApi\dashboard.properties""

Restart your Tomcat server. You should be able to run the UI that should connect to your API deployed within Tomcat successfully. Try it out!

I got this working by deploying the Hygieia API within the Tomcat container. Basically, the UI and the API are deployed within Tomcat and all the collectors are running as a stand-alone java processes. It works good and also provides an opportunity to scale-up & load balance APIs, if needed.

Let me know if you are interested in this deployment, I can document the changes (2 changes) and will send it out to you. spyndi

For example, in the case of the Jira collector, you can generate a token and use that in place of a password. In the case of SonarQube collector, a generated token stands in for the username and no password is required.

[],"Hello

Currently Hygieia allows the user to select a ""template"" from a hard coded list (capone, caponechatops, splitview, etc). The purpose from what I can tell (please correct me in the comments if I am wrong) is merely to change which widgets are displayed on initial dashboard creation. At this point there does not exist a way to easily create, modify, or delete these templates. 

My proposal is to remove the notion of these templates, and allow the users to select which widgets they would like to be displayed during the dashboard creation configuration window.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20029463/22209899/43d351b0-e145-11e6-8ee1-6233ab482f03.png)

The screenshot is a POC for the widgets on the ""Widget"" tab only. The change can easily be propagated to the ""Pipeline"" and ""Cloud"" tabs as well. In the case the all widgets are excluded, the tab will not show. For example, on the screen shot above, if all widgets are deselected, the ""Widget"" tab on the actual dashboard will be removed.

On a similar note, if a user decides that they would like all of the widgets shown in the example, the dashboard becomes too large to fit in one screen. Having a page that requires scrolling for an application like this may become cumbersome for users. 
Two solutions have been suggested for this:
* Limit the amount of widgets in a dashboard.
* If the page requires scrolling, have the page slowly move up and down automatically to show all widgets.

Both approaches have merit, please let me know if there is feedback.

This change would allow teams to show precisely the information they desire, and would result in a cleaner looking dashboard instance in the case that a team does not want to utilize all widgets included in a pre-baked template.

Looking forward, this change incorporates adding widgets directly to the dashboard object itself. This can be utilized in the future to allow addition/deletion of widgets to pre-exiting dashboards.",202568680,1116,Proposal to remove templates from UI,2017-01-23 15:40:58,2018-09-18 14:38:55,closed,2,brennanananan,"277077750 See https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1143 for PR brennanananan

274811339 Its' trying to convert a string to double for the story points. But the string is not numeric. I think your mapping ``feature.jiraStoryPointsFieldName=customfield_10001`` is incorrect. If you are not using story points, I would comment out that line.

But As I said everything seems to be running fine...just that am bit unsure about the startup error avadhmr
274087170 The cause of the null pointer is this: API call is made to retrieve a dashboard, but the dashboard is not there in the ""dashboard"" collection in Mongo. If you have removed the data from Mongo, I am thinking (a) there is some other browser instance still trying to pull up an old dashboard or (2) Your browser has the URL in the history and you are using that as a bookmark and that creates the error. 

Other than those, I cant think of anything else. Would like to see it in a screen share if possible.  tabladrum
274113025 Having said that, the API should return a 404 in this case. tabladrum
274368398 Well....all seems to be working nice today..I am not getting any error on starting UI and no exceptions are observed.

However, as I pointed out earlier For #1032  there are errors if your dashboard name has ""."" in it.....e.g. Overdraft-services1.0 had issues...but not overdraft-services. avadhmr
274368515 I am closing this, as the underline issue is not occurring anymore. Thanks for all the support. avadhmr
273946285 We are also facing the issue https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1032
 avadhmr
273949716 Have you manually modified any data? Or are you running a brand new install? tabladrum
273950028 I haven't done any manual modifications.
For #1032  I noticed it fails if your dashboard name has ""."" in it.....e.g.   Overdraft-services1.0 had issues...but not overdraft-services avadhmr
273950187 I deleted db...restarted machine...created db...started api....and on starting UI...still got the exceptions. avadhmr
273952899 Ok. For a quick check, can you clean your browser cache and see if anything changes. tabladrum
273955864 cleaning cache didn't help. still getting same error on starting UI
 avadhmr
273959027 Everything else seems to be running fine...apart from getting that exception at startup.....not sure if it is going to have some after effects at a later stage.

Is there anything we can do regarding dashboard names for #1032  avadhmr
273959308 Also noticed that your API version is 2.0.4 which is quite old. But that shouldn't cause an issue unless you have the latest UI tabladrum
273959690 yes..we were earlier using old UI...but now we have switched to latest one from master(we switched to latest once started facing these issues). But As I said everything seems to be running fine...just that am bit unsure about the startup error avadhmr

The UI layer is running, but not able to connect to the api layer. In my Chrome browser console, I see this error:

> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api-hygieia.apps.cluster.local/api/dashboard. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://ui-hygieia.apps.cluster.local' is therefore not allowed access.

When I add the cross-origin resource sharing extension to my browser, they are able to connect. 

Is there a better solution for this so all users won't have to add the extension?",201957584,1103,Cross-origin resource sharing error between api and ui,2017-01-19 19:49:09,2018-09-18 14:38:54,closed,2,jshpopelka272,"274180462 @amitmawkin please see. tabladrum
276089567 Update: I was able to find a solution to this CORS filter issue.

By adding these four lines of code into the LoggingFilter.java file and running the maven build on the api layer, cross origin domains are accepted.

`httpServletResponse.addHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*"");
httpServletResponse.addHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Methods"", ""GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"");			httpServletResponse.addHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Headers"", ""Content-Type"");
httpServletResponse.addHeader(""Access-Control-Max-Age"", ""1"");`

I'll be adding a pull request for this so others can avoid this issue. jshpopelka272

[],"Hi Team,

I am running only one team dash board and one product dashboard. Hygieia is build on three docker containers (mongo -->api --> ui). Collectors also run on the same server. I do not see much of CPU or high memory usage on servers. But every two days, the API container crashes with the below errors

274181324 Do you see anything wrong in the mongo container when this happens? tabladrum
274220293 I think, running DB, hygieia, collectos all on one VM is causing this issue..

the DB was intermittently accessible. 

I am planning/requesting for a trouble shooting session on Wednesday 10:00am, please let me know your availability @tabladrum 

Issues that i have currently are

1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of  data in database
2. Team dashboard has stash data but the product dash board shows blank when the same team dash board is part of product dashboard
3.  anandsit
274570796 @anandsit About #2 in your list, please see this: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1112#issuecomment-274189787

The VM sizing will purely depend upon what load it has. We internally spilt everything into multiple VMs: Mongo Clusters, API, UI and Collectors all run in different cloud instances. tabladrum
276096316 @anandsit Closed. About ""#1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of data in database"", Will be addressed with https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 satishc1

274181324 Do you see anything wrong in the mongo container when this happens? tabladrum
274220293 I think, running DB, hygieia, collectos all on one VM is causing this issue..

the DB was intermittently accessible. 

I am planning/requesting for a trouble shooting session on Wednesday 10:00am, please let me know your availability @tabladrum 

Issues that i have currently are

1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of  data in database
2. Team dashboard has stash data but the product dash board shows blank when the same team dash board is part of product dashboard
3.  anandsit
274570796 @anandsit About #2 in your list, please see this: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1112#issuecomment-274189787

The VM sizing will purely depend upon what load it has. We internally spilt everything into multiple VMs: Mongo Clusters, API, UI and Collectors all run in different cloud instances. tabladrum
276096316 @anandsit Closed. About ""#1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of data in database"", Will be addressed with https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 satishc1

[],"Hey guys,

I have compiled and integrated Hygieia Jenkins plugin. 
Configured it, configured my project, tested that API access is reachable from Jenkins.

After build I am getting success message:

` ""Hygieia: Published Build Complete Data. Response Code: 201. Response Value= 587e56fac9e77c000d08069f""`

In mongo database, `builds and collector_items collections` are not empty, - they have the data from jenkins.

Thanks!

274224058 Filename pattern is definitely wrong. At least should be *.*

But what is the file that actually is Getting deployed? A war file or files? tabladrum
282419162 @evaldasou Refer to https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/884 for how to setup the deployment job. Reopen if still an issue. satishc1
288902363 @tabladrum @satishc1 - thanks guys, just wanted to ask, - does it work overal for non java projects?
My artifacts are not .jar files at all. What should I use for file name pattern and artifact group then?

Thanks! evaldasou
274094191 Everything seems good if so? :) evaldasou
274102954 Hi @evaldasou builds show up in builds widget drop down. For deployment, publish deployment option. Are you using pipeline or standard job config?  tabladrum
274196855 Hi @tabladrum , I have used ""Freestyle project"" maybe that's an issue? 
Does it work only with ""Pipeline"" or ""Multibranch Pipeline"" ? 

Thanks! evaldasou
274205649 Works with freestyle as well as pipeline. For freestyle, configure Hygiea publisher as post build action and select to publish deploy data. You will need an App Name to publish under (this is the one you will select in Hygieia deploy widget config drop down), an env name (whatever you want such as Dev, QA, Prod etc), a namespace, select which artifacts are being deployed (files under your workspace, supports wildcard) and optionally version number. Supply version number if the filename does not contain version number.  tabladrum
274220340 Thanks @tabladrum , but I followed all the examples and configured it exactly it says. I am getting Hygieia plugin success messages in Jenkins... getting data in mongo database collections... 
However, I'm not able to see/select this data from Dashboard UI.

I mean,is it still possible that something wrong with my configuration, even if I am getting success messages and data in mongo?

273836876 Issue occurs when 'Any' is selected for teams. Should get fixed with #1030  MarkRx
273981607 Thanks for the update @MarkRx , i will try the updated code...also wanted to add one more point, in my Jira i have not added the team tempo plugin and i have not created any teams. But on Hygieia UI side under teams dropdown it's picking up the projects name as team names which seems like odd behaviour.

So in my case i am getting same names under the project and team dropdown on Hygieia UI. Shouldn't team dropdown display only 'any' in dropdown in case i havent congigured any teams in Jira? varundevopsid99

273302814 @tabladrum This is how my console looks now.., while fetching the jobs info seems like there is some problem. My Jenkins widget is still looking empty.

273414312 @tabladrum , I have added few log info's in this method makeRestCall which is in DefaultHudsonClient.java, just to check the values. The below is what it appears on the console --
```java
protected ResponseEntity<String> makeRestCall(String sUrl) throws MalformedURLException {
        URI thisuri = URI.create(sUrl);
        String userInfo = thisuri.getUserInfo();
        LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is url and uri:  ""+sUrl+""....""+thisuri);
        //get userinfo from URI or settings (in spring properties)
        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(userInfo) && (this.settings.getUsername() != null) && (this.settings.getApiKey() != null)) {
            userInfo = this.settings.getUsername() + "":"" + this.settings.getApiKey();
        }
        LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is userinfo and uri:  ""+userInfo);
        // Basic Auth only.
        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(userInfo)) {
        	LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m in if block"");
            return rest.exchange(thisuri, HttpMethod.GET,
                    new HttpEntity<>(createHeaders(userInfo)),
                    String.class);
        } else {
        	LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m in else block"");
            return rest.exchange(thisuri, HttpMethod.GET, null,
                    String.class);
        }

    }
```
In getBuildDetails method -
```java
ResponseEntity<String> result = makeRestCall(url);
            LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m result""+result);
```
**This is a bit lengthy log, I will cut it short if you want me to.**

wherever you are seeing ""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is userinfo and uri:  "", I am actually printing only userinfo here but not uri.

For each build of the job, why is the call happening two times once with actual values from properties file and the other null? both the if and else blocks are being executed here in this method.

272603765 I was able to get the Bitbucket collector to work finally, but I did find an issue.

273561935 @rdsteele @satishc1 - I followed the steps for generating the secret key and updated the same in

Thanks for your help in advance. asub927
273865733 So, my understanding is the password encryption error in the UI SCM widget configuration was solved by generating the secret key and adding that to the API properties file as 'key=secretkeyvalue'. This should allow the API to encrypt the password and store the credentials in the database. I also restarted my machine; stopping and starting the API process didn't seem to work for some reason, not sure why.

1. java -jar core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
    Your secret key is:
    NH***************************TC

2. Property added to api.properties (or whatever your file is named)
    key=NH********************************TC

Adding the secret key to the Bitbucket properties allows the collector to read the encrypted password from the database, decrypt it and call Bitbucket. If this fails, you'll probably be getting a 401 Unathorized error, which is how I discovered the issue with the '#' special character.

3. Property added to Bitbucket git.properties  (or whatever your file is named)

Hi Team,
Hygieaia documentation mentions about Performance Monitoring integration as well.
Where can I find that collector and which Performance monitoring tools are being integrated with the same. (For e..g. NewRelice/ Dynatrace etc)

UCD Version which i am using -  6.2.1. shilpsl1

@tabladrum, same here, there was a deployment yesterday. the version of the UCD is 6.2.2. shouebs

@shouebs  what version of UCD are you using ? shilpsl1

May be @tabladrum has to answer this... He said he would check and come back to me this week on this issue. But I did not hear anything so far from him .... shilpsl1
275188409 @shilpsl1 Thanks.
@tabladrum Please keep us posted if there is any progress with fixing the issue with UCD version 6.2 and above. shouebs
275200782 @shilpsl1 @tabladrum 
FYI - We are also using UCD 6.2.1 version and running into the same issue as reported above.

@tabladrum - I was doing some debugging with the UDeploy collector code and may have some additional data for troubleshooting.

I see that the method ""getLowestLevelChildren"" in DefaultUDeployClient class is returning a null JSONArray and hence the subsequent calls in the stack is not collecting any data for the widget.

`private JSONArray getLowestLevelChildren(JSONObject topParent, JSONArray returnArray) {
        JSONArray jsonChildren = (JSONArray) topParent.get(""children"");

        if (jsonChildren != null && jsonChildren.size() > 0) {
            for (Object child : jsonChildren) {
                if (!hasChildren((JSONObject) child)) {
                    returnArray.add(child);
                } else {
                    getLowestLevelChildren((JSONObject) child, returnArray);
                }
            }
        }
        return returnArray;
    }`

The input JSONObject to this method is -

{""parent"":{""inheritTeam"":false,""active"":true,""description"":""Test - Application"",""prototype"":false,""tags"":[],""impersonationForce"":false,""path"":""\/test-103831"",""security"":{""Delete"":false,""Manage Impersonation"":false,""Manage Teams"":false,""Edit Basic Settings"":false,""read"":false,""Map to Environments"":false,""View Resources"":false,""write"":false,""Manage Children"":false,""Create Resources"":false,""Manage Properties"":false},""hasAgent"":false,""name"":""test-103831"",""impersonationPassword"":""****"",""securityResourceId"":""d346ec32-9622-4364-92d2-4938617ca6bc"",""id"":""f3c72817-394e-48f5-8e4a-f314816a61f6"",""impersonationUseSudo"":false,""discoveryFailed"":false},""isRoot"":true,""inheritTeam"":true,""resource"":{""id"":""c0d838a4-fe9a-4533-a0b1-33c87629a701""},""hasChildren"":true,""active"":true,""description"":""CIT2"",""type"":""subresource"",""prototype"":false,""tags"":[],""impersonationForce"":false,""path"":""\/test-103831\/CIT2"",""security"":{""Delete"":false,""Manage Impersonation"":false,""Manage Teams"":false,""Edit Basic Settings"":false,""read"":true,""Map to Environments"":false,""View Resources"":true,""write"":false,""Manage Children"":false,""Create Resources"":false,""Manage Properties"":false},""hasAgent"":false,""versions"":[],""name"":""CIT2"",""impersonationPassword"":""****"",""securityResourceId"":""c0d838a4-fe9a-4533-a0b1-33c87629a701"",""id"":""301b972c-668e-4b9a-a0b0-4c9814889b40"",""impersonationUseSudo"":false,""discoveryFailed"":false}

In short, I don't see a ""children"" node or tag in this JSON construct. I wonder if there is an API/Response change between UCD 6.1.x and 6.2.x is the root cause of this issue.

BTW, the ""getLowestLevelChildren"" method is being called from ""getEnvironmentResourceStatusData"" method and I see a comment about some ""new logic"" that was introduced on Dec16/2015. Please check.

If you would like me to step through the code via. Webex let me know, we can schedule some time.

Were you able to review this thread? I would like to understand the action plan on this UDeploy collector issue. I can assist (if needed) to fix this issue. 

Thank you spyndi
278757450 Hi,
Anyone has any update regarding this.

Please let me know if anyone has go solution. Thank you!!! shilpsl1
282102799 @spyndi @tabladrum 
In DefaultUDeployClient getLowestLevelChildren needs to be changed to handle the 6.2 .  It might be a new api call to Udeploy to get the children based on ""hasChildren"": true . It needs to be backward compatible with 6.1 also.

The mapping we are looking for is for each childObject:
version
fileName

The images below show the actual uDeploy widget. The rows in the uDeploy widget are links for the various environments. The images for each link when you click on it is also shown.

282109676 @satishc1 
Are the above screen shots for 6.2 or 6.1 udeploy?
what does  It needs to be backward compatible with 6.1 also mean ? shilpsl1
282121929 @shilpsl1: @spyndi and we are collaborating to update the collector and make it compatible to both 6.2 and 6.1. Stay tuned. tabladrum
282124108 That's great!!! Thank you :+1:  shilpsl1
287832854 Hello all - just curious if anyone knows how soon there might be an update to the collector to make it compatible to both 6.2 and 6.1 uDeploy? Any info on that much appreciated. jlk1975
288009332 Hi tabladrum,

We are trying to connect and get the data from IBM UrbanCode Deploy tool(version 6.2.2.0.830952) via Hygieia code. we are able to get the application detail from configuration widget from dropdown. Once hit the save button from widget,In UCD not showing up in Hygieia Dashboard.


FYI,

Please find the image url

Also while running collector for UCD 6.2.2 we are not getting child element from parent node.So,how do we handle that.Is ther any roadmap for this to handle this issue.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23208312/24168636/e5fc571a-0ea0-11e7-8d21-3d85e4bd14b0.png)

Could you please assist to proceed futher on this.

288191867 @jlk1975 - I have started working on updating Hygieia uDeploy collector to use uDeploy API 6.2.x. Because of other priorities/delays on my side, the work/fix is still in progress. 
I'm targeting the fix to be ready for testing by end of this month. (03/31). Let's touch base next week. spyndi
288192348 @gokulknewt  - You are running into the same issue that is documented in this issue/thread. The Hygieia uDeploy collector needs to be updated to work with uDeploy version 6.2.x.
 spyndi
288381627 @spyndi - Thank you very much for the response and for working towards a resolution! jlk1975
288458668 Thanks lot team for your support.Once done kindly let us know. gokulknewt
290697033 @spyndi - Hi, just checking in with you to see if the updates to the Hygieia uDeploy collector to use uDeploy API 6.2.x might be ready for testing anytime soon? Thanks again for all your work on this! jlk1975

An update,
There is quite a lot of changes with 6.2 API, so it's getting a little challenging with incorporating these changes in the existing collector and back porting with 6.1 implementation . I have collected some data points for discussion with @satishc1  and @tabladrum, to make sure it fulfills the existing UI flow and requirement.  Will be reviewing with them shortly.

Has anyone looked into UDeploy 6.2 API? I would like to brainstorm some thoughts/ideas on the implementation.

Thank you. spyndi
291496343 @satishc1 @tabladrum 

Satish/Topo,

Are you available for a conference call to review the UDeploy 6.2 API findings and also to validate the implementation?

293673370 @Spyndi, Have you done the code migration for UCD 6.2.2? Kindly let me know gokulknewt
293759724 @spyndi, 
I've been looking at UCD 6.2.1 API but I don't see anything obvious and ""elegant"" that would return inventory and compliance information. 
 
The only thing I found that is close to what we need is ApplicationProcessRequest resource, it returns the deployment information containing deployment status, component version and environment, but the problem is in getting ApplicationProcessRequest ID in the first place. I couldn't find a way to get it.

Did anyone find better solution? Please share your idea(s).

Thanks,

295298802 @gokulknewt @git4giri @vvigreen981 

Sorry, just got back from my vacation. I don't have any additional updates on the progress.

I'm finding it bit challenging to retrofit UDeploy 6.2.2 API to accommodate the existing Hygieia Udeploy Collector code/process flow. It appears, we may need to completely re-design/re-engineer the Udeploy collector to support Udeploy API 6.2.2.

I have also reached out to Topo @tabladrum  and Satish @satishc1 for some directions as they are the original authors on this collector.

Victor - It looks like you also reviewed the 6.2.2 API. Are you available to discuss the flow/share your findings and brain storm on an approach?

Thank you.

1. Started api layer using java jar command
2. Started UI layer using gulp command.

271574154 You have a monitoring widget referencing a service that cannot be found in your database MarkRx

I added a service which was failing, later removed the same service, still the same error.
Any idea, how do I add the same in my database

 Hi Topo
Recently I have updated the code with latest git pull. Tried to rebuild the Jenkins Hygieia Publisher plugin. its failing with the compilation ERROR as below screen shot.
I am building it with maven 3.3.9 and Jdk 1.8

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3480342/21794505/d703acf2-d720-11e6-819e-7d07f311debc.png)

I have freshly pulled the latest code, cleared the maven cache and build the package. I am able to build all the components.
Step 1:Generated a new hygieia-publisher plugin file (.hpi), uploaded the same under Jenkins manage plugin option.
Step 2: Create a testingNew jenkins job with basic configuration (without post build action of Hygieia publisher), the jenkins job build is success
Step 3: updated the testingNew jenkins job and included post build action Hygieiapublisher and triggered the build.
Result: My jenkins job is going into infite loop and doesnot show anything in jenkins Console. It requires me to manually kill the particular job in order to terminate the job.
this happens only when I am enabling post build action fr hygieia publisher.
Below are the screen shot for configuration and log.

273217845 Can you uninstall the plugin and run the job and see if it builds okay?
never mind - I see that without the post build action, your job runs fine. tabladrum
273267495 @Mahendra1260 I've tried several permutations but I'm unable to recreate the issue u are having. 
And I'm assuming you have configured the Hygieia Server URL under 
Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Hygieia Publisher Settings
If you are on https://gitter.im/capitalone/Hygieia send me a message and we can setup a time to do a conf call if you wish. satishc1
273387345 @satishc1 @tabladrum 
yes, I have configured Hygieia Server URL and tested the connection as well. It is success..
Yes, I am there on gitter, let me ping you there too..
Meanwhile, let me try other permutation by uninstalling and try installing the old hygieia plugin to see if I face this issue only with new one or what. Mahendra1260
273886066 @satishc1 @MarkRx @tabladrum 
Thanks a lot Satish for your time and helping me to resolve the issue over the call.

Also, when I am trying to publish the deployment data with the previous build .hpi, it thows the exception as below Jenkins log

Jenkins Log: Output:

271573184 Try clearing your maven cache then rebuilding the core layer. Double check that it is installed correctly. Check the maven file in the jenkins publisher to see if it is pulling it in. MarkRx
271613422 Let me try doing it as mentioned. Mahendra1260
271680983 @MarkRx 
I deleted the cache and rebuilt core, which generated core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar. 
While trying to build publisher plugin, it threw a dependency error as pom.xml for hygieia-publisher file has  dependency mentioned for core-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar.
As this: 
_<dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>2.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>_

**I feel it should be** 
_<dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>2.0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>_

then only a fresh hpi plugin can be build successfully.
 Mahendra1260
271681166 Closed it by mistake Mahendra1260
271700350 Yes it should. @amitmawkin @tabladrum why isn't the jenkins plugin part of the travis build? MarkRx
271807802 @MarkRx @tabladrum 
I have rebuilt the core package and new version of hygie-publisher plugin. Still while running the Jenkins job where I am using post build action to deploy build and deployment status to Hygieia Dashboard, it fails with below error:

**Jenkins Log:** 
```

272076336 @nireeshT : Which repository package you are talking about?  Mahendra1260
272174971 Do you have a jenkins job with a lot of folders? Perhaps try increasing the stack size. Otherwise it could be getting stuck in an infinite loop. MarkRx
272373612 
@MarkRx 
No, the Jenkins job is a plain testing job with simple echo statement. All i am doing is just publishing the dummy deployment data.
I runs well without the Hygieia publisher plugin but the moment configure Hygieia Publisher plugin as post build action, it starts throwing the Stack OverFlow ERROR.
Seems something to do with Hygiaia publisher plugin Mahendra1260
272460170 @tabladrum @satishc1 could be related to that recursion that was added MarkRx
272475551 @Mahendra1260 Did you rebuild the api module with the latest codebase ? Since the codebase has been updated, you will need to update all your modules.. ui , api. satishc1
272773323 @satishc1 
Yes, I have rebuild it entire codebase and its is running all on 2.0.5-SNAPSHOT. I have also regenerated the hygieia-publisher hpi file and uplaoded it into Jenkins plugin.
I am observing this issue after I updated to latest code Mahendra1260
272792922 @satishc1 
Recently started seeing this error message

```
Hygieia: Failed Publishing Build Complete Data. Response Code: 500. Response Value= {timestamp:1484552466922,status:500,error:Internal Server Error,exception:java.lang.OutOfMemoryError,message:Java heap space,path:/api/build}
```

Dont know why it only happens when I configure post build action as Hygieia publisher? Mahendra1260
273027682 @satishc1 @tabladrum 
My observations

Case1: When I have created a pipeline job in Jenkins 2.x and trying to publish the build status and deployment data.
Jenkins Console Output: 
```
[Pipeline] hygieiaDeployPublishStep
Hygieia: Published Build Data For Deployment Publishing. Response Code: 201. Response Value= 587dacdaf271872ea74f5c2e
```
but, nowhere I am able to see the data on Dashboard, where and under which widget I can see the deployment data if it is success??
Also, Jenkins collector always shows the above build as Green success even though the build fails

Case 2: When i am creating the normal free style job on Jenkins2.x and using post build action for hygieia plugin, gets the below error always
Jenkins console: 
```
Finished Calculation of disk usage of workspace in 0 seconds
Hygieia: Failed Publishing Build Complete Data. Response Code: 500. Response Value= {timestamp:1484628987868,status:500,error:Internal Server Error,exception:java.lang.StackOverflowError,message:No message available,path:/api/build}

271630044 @shilpsl1  - Can you provide below information

1) Is UDeploy collector running ?
2) Any error from the collector log?
3) Alternatively have you tried configuring Hygieia publisher for Jenkins.

[],"Hi,

I am trying to setup the dashboard. I have built all the jar files. Below are the steps which i have done. 

1. Started Mongo DB
2. Started API
3. Started Jenkins Collector
4. Started UI

I was able to create a user and login to the User in the UI. I have created my own project/team dashboard. When i create one, its not getting reflecting back in the UI. The dashboard name is inserted into the DB though. Not able to see the dashboard names even if restart the UI.

What am i missing here ?

As per my understanding of the documentation, once i start all the above(DB,API,Collector and UI), i should be able to see the Jenkins information in the dashboard. 
What am i missing here? as i dont see any information or details about Jenkins in the dashboard. I am not sure if the Jenkins collector is talking to the API and API is passing on the information to the dashboard.

271295343 Correct @MarkRx, we will be making admin a ""role"", so you can have multiple admin accounts.  We do not intend on adding functionality to add new admins with #1031 however, we felt that was beyond the scope of the pull request.  We just wanted to get it back to the current state with backend security.  We did lay the groundwork to make it possible though.   rob-miller-777

[],"I got following error after I started Bitbucket collector.  I noticed that both Projects and Pepos are missing in the URL http://mycompany.com/rest/api/1.0/projects//repos//commits?until=Develop&limit=25.  When configuring the Code Repo widget, only Repo URL and Branch are required, I also gave my credentials for the code repo in this case.  

Did I miss something?  Do I need modify the collector code DefaultBitbucketServerClient?

Thank you very much for the help!

That was the problem!
When I configured the Code Repo widget, Code Repo's host was used.  
After changed to Code Repo's URL and with Credentials, now I got both project and repo displayed.
    
I tried both in the Code Repo Widget
    http://mylogin@mybitbucketrepo.com/scm/ABC/XYZ.git	
    http://mybitbucketrepo.com/scm/ABC/XYZ.git	
However, I still get error as show below the property file.

271342061 What version is your bitbucket server? Is it behind a proxy?

Hit this url in a browser:

271356686 My Bitbucket server uses Atlassian Bitbucket v4.2.0.  Is it behind a proxy?  I need find it later. 

Also, I found the branch name should be develop (lowercase), instead of Develop.
However, when I directly hit URL http://mybitbucketrepo.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/ABC/repos/XYZ/commits?until=develop&limit=25, I got 
Unable to open http://mybitbucketrepo.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/ABC/repos/XYZ/commits?until=develop&limit=25.  Cannot download the information you requested.

If I copy the URL to browser, I can get all the data.

After I reconfigured Code Repo widget with correct Branch name, now collector has no error anymore, but just stuck there:

You can temporarily modify the properties-builder.sh and add debug then build it:

271362230 Is it a large repo?

You can temporarily modify the properties-builder.sh and add debug then build it:

> logging.level.com.capitalone.dashboard.collector=DEBUG MarkRx
271394737 Hi MarkRx,

The Bitbucket collector is working now and the data is flowing.  It actually didn't stuck!  I didn't wait long enough, especially the first time.

Thank you so much for the help! zenglincui

``` zenglincui
272922936 This issue seems related to user credentials.  Anyone has a clue how to configure?

Here is what I found:
If I try to access http://bamboo.mycompay.com/rest/api/latest/result/ABC-DEV/1867 from browser, it fails.  
When this happens, I need go to http://bamboo.mycompay.com, and login.  After login, I am able to access from browser and get all data for http://bamboo.mycompay.com/rest/api/latest/result/ABC-DEV/1867. zenglincui
276017943 I am also getting the same error. Have the same content in the application properties file as mentioned in the thread above. 
I tried accessing the URL in browser and able to see content of the URL without logging into Bamboo. Even curl <URL> is returning the content without any error.

What configuration are we missing?

279604215 @Ramesh18190 : I was able to get through this yesterday. I suspect this error is due permissions issue. I am not getting this error now when I used a different user credentials. Does the user with which you are connecting to bamboo have admin privileges? roshanvc
279604909 @roshanvc Yes, I am connecting with admin privileges, but 404 not found is not for authentication right. 
I am giving  ""bamboo.apiKey=mypassword"", is this right or do we to generate apiKey?, if yes, please help how can I generate that? Ramesh18190
279606026 Yes, that is the right way. I have also given password in the same way roshanvc
283079033 I did not try this for long time until yesterday.  However, I still have problem to get the Bamboo flowing to the dashboard.  From the log I can the connector seems reading from Bamboo with:

This seems not a permission issue, right?
Anybody can help please?

another problem:

277576648 Hi, I got the same issue and see the #957, but still not found the point. podormeijia
279837315 @taozi34 @guanzhongpeng Try with the lastest codebase. Run the gitlab collector once before trying to save the UI config. If your gitlab host uses https, import the cert into the jvm that's running your gitlab collector.

The only properties you need for gitlab are:
```
dbname=yourdbname
dbhost=yourdbhost
dbport=27017
dbusername=youruser
dbpassword=yourpass
logging.file=./logs/gitlab.log

gitlab.cron=*/5 * * * * *
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15
#Gitlab host (optional, defaults to ""gitlab.com"")
gitlab.host=gitlab.company.com
#Gitlab protocol (optional, defaults to ""http"")
gitlab.protocol=http
#Gitlab port (optional, defaults to protocol default port)
gitlab.port=80
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false
gitlab.apiToken=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Reopen if still an issue.

309608468 I have exact same issue. I am using latest code from master (from 2 days ago).
My application.properties is as below,
`# Database Name
dbname=dashboard
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=dbpassword

logging.file=./logs/gitlab.log
gitlab.cron=*/5 * * * * *
gitlab.host=<gitlabs.mycompany.com>
gitlab.protocol=http
gitlab.port=8089
#gitlab.path=/gitlab/resides/here
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false
gitlab.apiToken=<token>
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15`

Below is what I see from collector logs:,

277576648 Hi, I got the same issue and see the #957, but still not found the point. podormeijia
279837315 @taozi34 @guanzhongpeng Try with the lastest codebase. Run the gitlab collector once before trying to save the UI config. If your gitlab host uses https, import the cert into the jvm that's running your gitlab collector.

The only properties you need for gitlab are:
```
dbname=yourdbname
dbhost=yourdbhost
dbport=27017
dbusername=youruser
dbpassword=yourpass
logging.file=./logs/gitlab.log

gitlab.cron=*/5 * * * * *
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15
#Gitlab host (optional, defaults to ""gitlab.com"")
gitlab.host=gitlab.company.com
#Gitlab protocol (optional, defaults to ""http"")
gitlab.protocol=http
#Gitlab port (optional, defaults to protocol default port)
gitlab.port=80
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false
gitlab.apiToken=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Reopen if still an issue.

309608468 I have exact same issue. I am using latest code from master (from 2 days ago).
My application.properties is as below,
`# Database Name
dbname=dashboard
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=dbpassword

logging.file=./logs/gitlab.log
gitlab.cron=*/5 * * * * *
gitlab.host=<gitlabs.mycompany.com>
gitlab.protocol=http
gitlab.port=8089
#gitlab.path=/gitlab/resides/here
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false
gitlab.apiToken=<token>
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15`

Below is what I see from collector logs:,

@tabladrum @amitmawkin any feedback on client pagination? mdavis40
275130798 @mdskd conflict resolved. Mpluya
276754643 @Mpluya Thanks for the contribution. Can you please add a screenshot and some details on how the UI looks with this change? If you search for something in the ui select dropdown, and if it returns the first 20 hits, is there a next (prev) button for the user to select and look through the results ? satishc1
276963572 @satishc1 below is a screenshot of how configuring jenkins or sonar looks like with this enhancement. 

The way we (@rob-miller-777 and I) have it configured is:

- on click to the search field without typing anything, it will send a server side request without any search criteria but the size of 20 
`api/collector/item/type/build?size=20`
- with the screenshot I provided below I typed in 'BusinessLine' as a search criteria. As I was typing this, the following server side requests were made:
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=Busines&size=20`
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=Business&size=20`
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=BusinessLine&size=20`
  This is so, because we've configured the search text field with a 250 ms of typeahead-wait-ms. Typeahead-wait-ms (from angular docs) is the minimal wait time after last character typed before typeahead kicks-in.

The idea is for users to type in what they are searching for and if the result they are looking for doesn't show up on the first 20 results, continue to refine the results by typing more.

Let me know if you need further details. Thanks.

 Mpluya
277287732 @Mpluya @rob-miller-777 @mdskd @tabladrum Thanks for the screenshot and the details. If the results are being paginated, there should be a prev and next button to browse the ""pages"". The user will not know why their ""desired"" result is not showing up in the first 20 or whatever number we set. While this is a great feature we really need it, can you explore the possibility of adding a way to browse through the search results ? Your thoughts ? satishc1
277299120 Yeah, I think it could benefit from some sort of infinite scroll.  I think we had looked into that, but finding a library that could handle the filtering and infinite scroll was challenging.  We could take a look again however.   rob-miller-777
277325841 agree with comments that some sort of paging in the ui would be good - infinite scroll fits more in this particular scenario from a ui design perspective.


Let take a look at this next week @rob-miller-777 mdavis40
278082914 @satishc1 @tabladrum We have been trying a few different things to utilize pagination.  Our first attempt was to add infinite scroll to the UIB-Typeahead directive.  This doesn't seem to be possible without either modifying the source code for the typeahead directive, or creating our own.  Neither of which seem ideal to us.  We also couldn't find any existing libraries that combine infinite scroll/pagination and filtering in a select dialog.  We are currently trying a different approach by adding a table/list of ""jobs"" to the form, and server side pagination and filtering on top of that.  The functionality is much easier to implement for this, however the user experience suffers a little bit as it takes up more of the screen, and there are more buttons to click for navigating.  So the two options we are looking at right now are keeping the functionality as is in this merge request, where to find your job, you have to continue to type your job name until it appears in the list.  Or we can add the table with filtering and pagination.  We will submit a merge request with the second option when ready. rob-miller-777
278103097 @rob-miller-777 @tabladrum  If the UIB-typeahead paginated scrolling is tough to implement, then given a choice between the 2 options, I would pick option 1. We can have a quick conference call if you have some time available. We are on gitter.im, if you wanna ping me at a convenient time. Thanks for researching this. satishc1
278133731 ![blurredss](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3252926/22710333/2398d7b6-ed3a-11e6-95b8-f4654a9060bf.png)

Here is what option 2 could look like.  Could make some small tweaks, but something along these lines.  I don't think I'll be able to use gitter.im right now since it hasn't been approved here for business use.  So for the time being, would you mind just communicating here?
 rob-miller-777
278136610 Just to be clear on the two options. 

1. Functions as is in this current merge request.  No pagination.  Have to type in the name of your job until it appears.

2. List of jobs which can be filtered and paginated through an input box and pagination directive. 

Pictures of both above.  rob-miller-777

Thanks you reply. But I have a question:  Jenkins cucumber plugin can generate unit test result in json files? In general, cucumber is used for Behaviour-Driven Development. But I still do not understand why the cucumber can also be used to produce unit test results？ wangjianwen
270149925 Yes it can. As long as there is a json file the hygieia plugin should work.  tabladrum

 tabladrum
270301930 Here is the command
```
java \
  -jar bamboo-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --spring.config.name=application.properties \
  --spring.config.location=C:\Hygieia\Hygieia-master\collectors\build\bamboo\target
```
I am executing the above command inside the folder C:\Hygieia\Hygieia-master\collectors\build\bamboo\target. Both the jar and the property file exists in the same location roshanvc
271214530 I have to copy the property file to target directory and use following command to resolve this issue.
```
~\bamboo\target\java \
  -jar bamboo-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --spring.config.name=bamboo \
  --spring.config.location=application.properties
``` zenglincui
271252668 The property file and the jar files are present in the same directory(target) already. I tried the above command but still get the same exception roshanvc
271399097 note the ``--spring.config.name=bamboo`` instead of ``--spring.config.name=application.properties`` tabladrum
271416611 In Windows, this command
```
~\bamboo\target\java \
  -jar bamboo-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar \

```
resolved the error mentioned, but I got a different error - ""404 Not found"" and could not make the data flow from Bamboo to the UI.  Refer to https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1072.

it doesn't recognize the path if I use something like
```

This suggests your url is wrong. MarkRx
270329008 My base url was https://del.tools.publicis.sapient.com/bitbucket and in DefaultBitBuckerServer client there was some logic written that it takes host just del.tools.publicis.sapient.com not including bitbucket so generated link was not correct. I changed the java file , some how i managed to generate a valid link
https://del.tools.publicis.sapient.com/bitbucket/rest/api/1.0/projects/mram/repos/aries-component-test/commits?until=dev&limit=25

@MarkRx I think this logic in UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/config.js is not quite correct

Would it make more sense for the collector to record the deployment server as a compound key?

i.e.
```json
[
  {
    ""applicationId"": ""MyTestApp"",
    ""deployServer"": ""TestJenkins""
  },
  {
    ""applicationId"": ""MySecondApp"",
    ""deployServer"": ""TestJenkins""
  },
  {
    ""applicationId"": ""AnotherTestApp"",
    ""deployServer"": ""TestJenkins""
  }
]
```

I'm not sure exactly what the data looks like that the widget is displaying or if I completely understand the problem, but this data model would make it possible to group/aggregate by deploy server, as proposed. mrpudn
270125129 @mrpudn changing the collectors / collector_items around would be a big undertaking and would most certainly not be backwards compatible.

@tabladrum Looks fine so long as the same guid implies the same name (meaning we don't care about renaming). Just note I don't see the api endpoint I made going away as there are more uses for it. For example: Configurable Pipeline Stage Names #1020 MarkRx
270130185 @MarkRx The ""System Config"" API should evolve. For this particular instance we will rely on the UI config ability. tabladrum
270131578 Sounds good. MarkRx
270150077 https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1055 tabladrum
269544000 Do the created collector items have unique options.applicationId's? Can you post them? The assumption would be that ""MyTestApp"", ""MySecondApp"", and ""AnotherTestApp"" would each have their own unique applicationId. If not then they will be treated as the same application if they all have the same instanceUrl (and thus assume they have the same application name for all 3 which is why the first name is used in the group)

```
var dataGrouped = dataGrouped = _(data)
                	.groupBy(function(d) { return (!multiServerEquality ? d.options.instanceUrl + ""#"" : """" ) + d.options.applicationId; })
                	.map(function(d) { return d; });
``` MarkRx
269547708 Ah. Got it. In my case (testing jenkins plugin) I had the same instanceUrl. And no applicationId in the collector item option. May be the workaround is to put Job url in the ""instanceUrl"". Not sure yet. But manually editing the json document to make the instance url the job url did work. 

Noticed that if I turn the grouping off, it still groups.  tabladrum
269574464 @MarkRx the following code should work both ways:
``` 
var dataGrouped =  _(data)
                	.groupBy(function(d) { return (!multiServerEquality || d.options.applicationId == null ? d.options.instanceUrl + ""#""+d.options.applicationName : """" ) + d.options.applicationId; })
                	.map(function(d) { return d; });
```
Can you test this change locally?  tabladrum
269631174 I think the proper solution should be to have the jenkins plugin assign each application an applicationId. That field really shouldn't be nullable as it is meant to be an identifier. The identifier could be something arbitrary like the md5sum of the instanceUrl + applicationName. It's possible there are other parts of the code that will choke if it is null.



Since a.applicationId == b.applicationId implies a.applicationName == b.applicationName you can use this:

```
var dataGrouped = dataGrouped = _(data)
                	.groupBy(function(d) { return (!multiServerEquality ? d.options.instanceUrl + ""#"" : """" ) + d.options.applicationName + ""#"" + d.options.applicationId; })
                	.map(function(d) { return d; });
``` MarkRx
269642107 The origin of applicationID was from uDeploy that had some kind of of UUID for each applicationID. I am sure this ID will change if the same App was setup in another ""Prod"" uDeploy server. May be we should create another ID (some kind of CMDB identifier)? In your case, how are you keeping this ID same across multiple deployment server? tabladrum
269650311 I kind of ""cheated"". XLD uses composite path keys based on the names of items in the path. Since this is the case the applicationId remains the same so long as they have the same path.

For example:

Server1:
Id: Applications/Foo/Bar
Name: Bar

Server2:
Id: Applications/Foo/Bar
Name: Bar

 MarkRx
269986021 @MarkRx @amitmawkin @satishc1 @mrpudn please review these following change proposal before I submit it in a PR form:

With PR https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/891 there was a change in how deployed Apps were grouped together by ""deploying server""s. Nice change. This allows to visualize an App deployment where different deployment servers (such as QA Jenkins, Prod Jenkins or whatever) are deploying the same app.

There are two major changes in that PR:
1. New API for to return a boolean attribute (systemConfig.multipleDeploymentServers) to the API properties file that determines if servers need to be grouped. 
2. UI changes to group the servers in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/config.js and https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/config.html

I am proposing a refactor of #1 and slight change to #2.

**Slight Change to #2**: Instead of relying on non-null applicationId, I am proposing a non-null applicationName + applicationId check in grouping of elements:

*Old code* (https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/config.js)
```
                var dataGrouped = _(data)
                    .groupBy(function(d) { return (!multiServerEquality ? d.options.instanceUrl + ""#"" : """" ) + d.options.applicationId; })
                    .map(function(d) { return d; });
```

*Proposed change*

```
                var dataGrouped = _(data)
                    .groupBy(function(d) { return (!multiServerEquality ? d.options.instanceUrl + ""#"" : """" ) + d.options.applicationName + d.options.applicationId; })
                    .map(function(d) { return d; });
```



**Refactoring of #1**
Instead of capturing/configuring the ""multipleDeploymentServers"" property via API, I am proposing that we do that in the UI and store each individual dashboard's choice in the ""dashboard"" document in dashboard -> widgets -> options section of the json document:

```
        {
            ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5863ed079220ab16e6a1c3c8""),
            ""name"" : ""deploy"",
            ""componentId"" : ObjectId(""583394884969c83f6715b588""),
            ""options"" : {
                ""id"" : ""deploy0"",
                ""aggregateServers"" : true
            }
        }, 
```

Corresponding UI changes are pretty simple. 
*Add a check box in deploy widget config:*
```
        <div class=""form-group checkbox"">
            <label>
                <input type=""checkbox"" name=""aggregateServers"" ng-model=""deployConfig.aggregateServers"" ng-change=""reload()"">
                Aggregate Servers
            </label>
        </div>
```
Add a new variables in the corresponding controller (config.js) and add a function that looks like this:

```
        $scope.reload = function() {
            processResponse(ctrl.currentData);
        };
```

And store the currentData in a global variable after the data is obtained from the API calls.

With these changes, there will be no API needed to save/retrieve the config and the config is set for each individual dashboard.

Thoughts?

268987955 @pxk5958 is actually investigating this right now. We also have 10000's of Jenkins jobs and the build widget config in-particular is not very responsive. We have found two causes:

- The angular module ui-select has several well known performance problems. @pxk5958 was looking into using an alternative called selectize.
- For some reason spring is taking a long time to serialize the database results into objects. Results return quickly when using a mongo utility.

Does paging really help? I don't think the actual network load is an issue. You might be seeing a perceived increase in performance because the reduction in data addresses reduces the effects of both issues above.

@MarkRx Question for you: the Metadata section in ArtifactBuilder will not work for pipeline. Instead of getting the SCM metadata from envVar, I will get it from the build data that I already have in that section of the code. May be a second thought on the meta data? Do we need it? Or should reduce duplication and have only the meta data? In any case, pipeline api returns a list of SCMs and I will have to handle it as a list - which means the SCM metadata must be a list.

The metadata is needed. It wouldn't make sense for metadata to be a list as it is simply a key-value property holder (that corresponds to artifactory properties). Instead you could use a numbering scheme similar to how jenkins handles multiple repositories. Example:

```
scmUrl: ""url"",

376259774 My API Connectivity is showing a red circle with a ""X"" so I am assuming there is no connectivity.  Do I need both a dashboard.properties and api.properties? mhoffman78
376532859 Hey there!

You need the properties file in the UI side, that red mark means that you
don't have the connectivity to the API.

Cheers!

268613474 Try this from the `/Hygieia-master` root directory:
```bash
java -jar api/target/api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties
```

Also, make sure you can connect to your MongoDB instance at `10.0.0.0:27017` and that you've created the `dashboarduser` MongoDB user with password `dbpassword`.

Try to connect with the mongo shell:
```bash
mongo mongodb://dashboarduser@dbpassword:10.0.0.0:27017/dashboard
``` mrpudn
268654416 I got fix Db issue...

268659915 you need to build the complete project including the api and the collectors amitmawkin
268714550 That is the problem I am facing.How can I do run the build.
If I run as root user, UI build fails saying Bower cannot install . If I run as non root user other build fails. How do I make it fully run. shilpsl1
268824201 Please refer to this article regarding global node module permissions:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

You need to install bower properly in order for the build to succeed mrpudn
268856492 I am not sure whether it is really a problem with npm, I still tried npm permissions from the link you provided. But still no use. I had to end up in,

268880754 Once the build is success i created dashboard.properties and ran

268906109 It's generally considered bad practice to give more permissions to something than it requires. Some libraries put safeguards in place to deter you from giving too many permissions to things:

As for the error you're getting - I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like a spring config error. I think @amitmawkin was the one who added the version number to the `PingController`, so I'll defer to him mrpudn
269067920 Can I please get if any updates available for the above error. I am tired fixing it  :(
 shilpsl1
269499943 @shilpsl1 are you running a maven build , cause as part of build it generates a file containing the version number under the api project, in your case looks like it is not happening. 

What command are you using for build? amitmawkin
269798716 @amitmawkin 
I ran -- `mvn clean install package` in hygieia-master folder and the build was success.

After the build, in api folder:
```
api]$ ls
docker  logs  pom.xml  README.md  src  target

Then created dashboard.properties files in Hygieia-master/api/target 
```properties

270991368 @shilpsl1 
Add this line to your dashboard.properties file

version.number=@application.version.number@

And then run the api with the command 
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.name=api --spring.config.location=/yourfullpathto/dashboard.properties satishc1

You need the properties file in the UI side, that red mark means that you
don't have the connectivity to the API.

268322715 No problem at all! That's what we're here for :)

The setup instructions could use revamping, so it's totally understandable.

Ok, looks like the build is failing due to this:
```

You'll need to install `bower`. Please refer to the UI instructions [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/UI). mrpudn
268343778 Thank you so much for your kind response :+1:  

I am using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5. After referring the link which you provided, I installed nodejs npm. Then I moved to UI folder and ran the command `npm install -j bower`
and I get below output, I am not sure whether this is desired output or not.

Am I on right track ?? shilpsl1
268355038 Yup, that's what you want to see. Make sure you installed bower globally, i.e. `npm install -g bower`

Now you should be able to do a `gulp serve` to get the UI started. mrpudn

# gulp --version

 shilpsl1
268355391 Ah, sorry I just edited my previous post - it looks like you specified `-j` instead of `-g`. `-g` will install the node module globally, then you can use it on the command-line, i.e. `bower` and `gulp`.

After you get bower and gulp:
```
bower install
gulp serve
``` mrpudn
268370435 oops, Sorry For my ignorance. Thank you so much!!! That helped a lot :) shilpsl1
268380327 No problem - were you able to get everything resolved? mrpudn
268534230 Yes I got the UI page but API I am yet to configure... It shows API Layer Down, I need to work on it now. shilpsl1
268552696 Yup - should be a matter of running that original `mvn clean install package` from the project's root directory and then following the steps for starting the API.

If you have any further issues, please let us know! As this initial issue seems to be resolved, please create a new issue going forward :) mrpudn
268558135 Sure .... Thank you so much !!!

268311865 I resolved the issue.  Problem was in by .bowerrc file.  

I had following in the file:
```
{
  ""directory"": ""library"",
  ""registry"": ""http://bower.herokuapp.com"",
  ""proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS_:PORT_HERE]"",
  ""https-proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT_HERE]""
}
```

When I changed to this:
```
{
  ""proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS_:PORT_HERE]"",		
  ""https-proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT_HERE]""
}
```
It worked.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. Mark-Smithh
268323424 Ah, ok - glad to see you got it resolved.

As a side note - you shouldn't have to set the bower proxy settings explicitly like that. It should honor your `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, if you have them set. Most tools follow this convention, which makes things much easier behind a proxy. mrpudn

268311865 I resolved the issue.  Problem was in by .bowerrc file.  

I had following in the file:
```
{
  ""directory"": ""library"",
  ""registry"": ""http://bower.herokuapp.com"",
  ""proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS_:PORT_HERE]"",
  ""https-proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT_HERE]""
}
```

When I changed to this:
```
{
  ""proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS_:PORT_HERE]"",		
  ""https-proxy"": ""[PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT_HERE]""
}
```
It worked.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. Mark-Smithh
268323424 Ah, ok - glad to see you got it resolved.

As a side note - you shouldn't have to set the bower proxy settings explicitly like that. It should honor your `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, if you have them set. Most tools follow this convention, which makes things much easier behind a proxy. mrpudn

267062248 Thanks for finding out the missing property. Let me try build with this also..

Additionally, while trying to get customfield, I am getting some binary output instead of json output.

Like:
https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

it gives some binary symbol output. Any reason why? Mahendra1260
267077157 @MarkRx  i am able to build the collector after adding the missing property..

What does it mean by **[some-issue-name],** does it mean the issue id? or issue number?#

how to find the customefield from the above url.

Suppose i have an issue whose number is TEAM-1234. How do I make the url to fetch the right data?

268196836 @MarkRx 
While JIRA collector integration, in my properties file I have mentioned the project ID for the project I want to analyse. While selecting the project in Dashboard UI, I can see all the project which are there on my JIRA instance. 
Why I am seeing all the project in the list even though I have given one ID in the properties file:? Mahendra1260
268243855 There is no spot in the properties file to restrict to a specific project. The jira collector will gather all project names and provide them as a drop down. MarkRx
268442363 Thanks @MarkRx  for the reply.
I noticed one property in the properties files as below
**_feature.jiraProjectId=MyProjectID_**

What is the significance of the above property ?

I am not having acces to the other Projects, even then also I am seeing data from such projects. Do you think its a matter on security concern?

 Mahendra1260
268521095 There is no field called feature.jiraProjectID. I do not know where that came from.

Jira does not have a user role system. The jira collector will pick up whatever the user has access to that is defined in the jira collector properties. Creating such a system is no small task and I don't see it being done any time soon if at all. MarkRx
269526030 No activity , hence closing this issue. @Mahendra1260  if you feel you still have issues you can open a new one amitmawkin
289684507 @Mahendra1260 Did you get answer to these questions? I have the same doubt.

[],"We have been looking into the security in Hygieia and have some concerns with how it’s implemented.  It looks like there is a call to the API service to login, but after that, all the authorization is in javascript and based on a couple cookies.  Security can be bypassed completely with very little effort.  Is there any work being done to address this? If not, we might look into improving this.",195025372,1031,Authentication/Security Concerns,2016-12-12 16:50:25,2017-08-07 02:09:52,closed,42,rob-miller-777,"298747096 Sorry, that comment was in regards to @montapas , I haven't attempted to use ldaps, so it is possible, but I don't have a way to test it.  rob-miller-777
298747262 Probably better to open new issues for these questions instead of reusing this one. rob-miller-777
320539896 finallllllllly.  This was really painful guys. I have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to get the auth token for API.  Thought the API set up  info was outdated as I did not see any settings panel.  The API start up guide needs to mention 2 things: auth.authenticationProviders=STANDARD needs to be set to allow a user to be created....and on set up the user: admin needs to be created immediately.  I looked through the start up guides again and I do not see anything referencing these facts.  It would really help to have them stated in bold. htvan1
320540043 @satishc1 @Megha849 can you see this? tabladrum
320551684 Also I am now not sure if the API guide's section on Securing APIs Basic Auth...is correct even when I have the API token from the admin screen.  I tried those lines of code to encode the api token I got. Then added the user name and auth token in as headers... still got 401 unauthorized.  I suppose that would be a different ticket, but a full run though example in the guide would do wonders.   Thanks @tabladrum for helping me sort out the tribal knowledge in the API guide. htvan1
266487101 There is - from LDAP, OAUTh etc to API token based authentication.  tabladrum
266487195 But won't complain if you help :-) tabladrum
266488753 Yeah, @brennanananan has been working on integrating with ldap here.  I think the biggest issue we have found is that you can change a cookie value right now on the client and be any user you want to be.  We think we need to implement some sort of backend security to the api calls, which would probably mean utilizing spring security on the API.  rob-miller-777
266491902 We saw it too. It's on the list of things to look at. MarkRx
266504710 Currently the authentication from UI etc was there to only support personalization of dashboards.
All dashboard's are inherently in a read only mode, but can only be edit by the owner of those dashboards,
We need JWT for the API layer, and modify the auth to move from cookie mode to sending JWT tokens with each api request, when ever somebody login they will get a temp token that they need to send with each api request.  amitmawkin
266531813 Sounds good, @brennanananan and I are looking into implementing JWT.   rob-miller-777
266795130 It might be nice to add GitHub OAuth as a near-term SSO goal. LDAP can be heavy. mrpudn
270969656 Hey guys, just wanted to provide an update.  @brennanananan and I have put a lot of work into implementing security, and we are getting close to having it where we want.  From a users perspective, almost nothing has changed.  But the application is secure from the backend now.

**What we have done so far**
- Implemented JWT to provide stateless authentication/authorization
- Updated angular client to work with JWT tokens
- Made token expiration configurable
- Implemented redirect functionality to take you to the page you were viewing if you token expires and you have to login again
- Made secret key configurable to support having multiple instances of the API running
- Added Spring Security to Rest API
- Built in support for multiple forms of authentication (only standard Hygieia Auth implemented at this point, but adding others should be easy)
- Refactored current login to work with Spring Security
- Created a UserInfo Repository separate from the Authentication repository to support multiple forms of authentication.  This lets us control all application specific details of a user such as roles and themes independent of the authentication type. (Themes are still only handled by the angular app on the client, and saved in local storage, but this is something we can now save for a user if we want to)
- Made admin a ""role"" instead of just assigning admin privileges to the user named ""admin"". (Haven't implemented a way to assign new admins yet, so right now it works as before where the user named ""admin"" is given the role of admin)
- Added method level security to dashboard modification controller so only owners of the dashboard or admins can modify a dashboard
- Added support for having multiple owners of a dashboard (have not created anyway to assign multiple owners yet, but shouldn't be hard to do)
- Implemented new owner functionality in such a way that it won't break backwards compatibility

**What we have left**

- Clean up and refactor code
- Add and update some unit tests
- Document what we have done and how things work
- Document how to add additional forms of authentication (oauth, ldap, etc...)

Here is a link to the diff if you want to take a look at what we have so far: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/compare/master...StateFarmIns:springSecurityIntegration

Let us know if you have any questions or concerns on what we have, should have a pull request coming shortly.  
 rob-miller-777
272003768 Do you guys think you should have to be authenticated to view dashboards?  Or should you be able to view dashboards without logging in? rob-miller-777
272004379 You should be able to share a dashboard with anybody, irrespective of having an account or not.
  amitmawkin
272174216 Not sure I agree. I think it should be configurable if the ""anonymous"" user has view access. If Hygieia runs enterprise wide I'm not sure I want anyone in the company being able to see it. MarkRx
272175081 We started with a ""100% transparent"" dashboard mindset. Works for us very well. But I do realize that this may not fit in other organizations.  tabladrum
272210863 We will implemented with the ""100% transparent"" dashboard mindset, and it might be worth adding some functionality around private dashboards in the future.   rob-miller-777

Please help me montapas
275688247 Can you try going to the a dashboard directly, and seeing if you are able to retrieve data, or if you get CORS issues for those api calls as well?  I don't believe I made any changes that should have had this effect.  rob-miller-777
275690547 Thank you now I can able to standard login. I need to add extra header in StandardLoginRequestFilter.java 
but not able to login using LDAP. Please help me what to do? Also is it possible to SAML auth? montapas
275693699 To be able to utilize LDAP, you have to have configured the API to utilize your ldap server.  Which means providing the url to the LDAP server, and the DN string.  Without both of these present, the LDAP authentication provider will not be created.  The properties can be found in the README for the api.   rob-miller-777
275835709 I provided ldap url in .properties file. But i could not find any method like any attemptauth method in  ldaploginrequestfilter file. Please help montapas
276019592 I have downloaded the code from https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1031 
and my properties file is
auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:389
auth.ldapUserDnPattern=OU=Users,OU=WCB,OU=xxxx,OU=yyyy,OU=zzz,OU=qqqq,DC=qq,DC=com

Please suggest me what is wrong with me. montapas
276075158 Did you replace the username part with '{0}', as mentioned in the readme.  Looks like you are missing something like 'uid={0}' rob-miller-777
276093251 You mean auth.ldapUserDnPattern='uid={0}',OU=Users,OU=WCB,OU=xxxx,OU=yyyy,OU=zzz,OU=qqqq,DC=qq,DC=com montapas
276099050 Yeah, but without the surrounding ' '.   rob-miller-777
276338451 I have tried with this but no luck !!! please help me montapas
276349431 I also added the following method in LdapLoginRequestFilter.java file. it is showing bad credential
@Override
	 protected void unsuccessfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, AuthenticationException failed)
	         throws IOException, ServletException {
	     super.unsuccessfulAuthentication(request, response, failed);
	     LOGGER.info(""  failed.getMessage() : "" +   failed );
	     LOGGER.info(""  failed.getMessage() : "" +   failed.getMessage());
	 } montapas
276355786 Should I have to add any option when running API
java -jar D:\Office\Eclipse\wrkspc\Hygieia-master\api\target\api.jar --spring.config.location=D:\Office\Eclipse\collectors\dashboard.properties  
I am using this montapas
276376446 To use LDAP, should only need the server url and dn string you already have.  Can you paste the stack trace in here so we can see the issue.   rob-miller-777
276383929 I am getting bad credential error. montapas
276385006 Is there any way to override attemptAuthentication method in LdapLoginRequestFilter.java file. please help me I am stuck montapas
276388451 The ""attemptAuthentication"" method in the LdapLoginRequestFilter is responsible for pulling the username and password out of the request, and creating a ""UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken"" which will be handled by Spring Securities built in LDAP authentication provider.  From the issues you are having it seems like there are probably two potential issues you could be facing.  The first would be an improperly configured ldap server, most likely your DN string not being accurate.  The other possibility would be you are entering the wrong username/password combination on the login page.  I imagine both could give you the Bad Credential error.   rob-miller-777
293593695 @rob-miller-777 @montapas You are probably using ActiveDirectory. Support for AD will be available as a PR soon. satishc1
297659552 any update on AD ? montapas
298520408 Can I login in Hygieia without login prompt. I mean it will take my PC logged in user credential automatically and navigate to my dashboard page directly.
Please help me.
With Regards,
Tapas montapas
298697662 @Team,

Could you please suggest me?
We are implementing the LDAP integration with hygieia dashboard. In application.properties file
Can we use  ldaps or https protocol instead of ldap protocol.

Regards,
Gokul k gokulknewt
298703823 Have you tried something like `auth.ldapServerUrl=ldaps://{host}:{port}` in your application props? rob-miller-777
298705910 rob-miller-777- So far we didn't tried out. But Our Active directory for encrypted(Secure) purpose they are suggesting to use ldaps or https.Is it possible to either one we connect from Hygieia LDAP integration?

Thanks and Regards,
Gokul k

 gokulknewt
298740863 Hygieia does not support this functionality currently. rob-miller-777
298746637 Just for confirmation ,ldaps and https both it doesn't support?

 gokulknewt
298747096 Sorry, that comment was in regards to @montapas , I haven't attempted to use ldaps, so it is possible, but I don't have a way to test it.  rob-miller-777
298747262 Probably better to open new issues for these questions instead of reusing this one. rob-miller-777
320539896 finallllllllly.  This was really painful guys. I have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to get the auth token for API.  Thought the API set up  info was outdated as I did not see any settings panel.  The API start up guide needs to mention 2 things: auth.authenticationProviders=STANDARD needs to be set to allow a user to be created....and on set up the user: admin needs to be created immediately.  I looked through the start up guides again and I do not see anything referencing these facts.  It would really help to have them stated in bold. htvan1
320540043 @satishc1 @Megha849 can you see this? tabladrum
320551684 Also I am now not sure if the API guide's section on Securing APIs Basic Auth...is correct even when I have the API token from the admin screen.  I tried those lines of code to encode the api token I got. Then added the user name and auth token in as headers... still got 401 unauthorized.  I suppose that would be a different ticket, but a full run though example in the guide would do wonders.   Thanks @tabladrum for helping me sort out the tribal knowledge in the API guide. htvan1

",194976530,1029,Jira widget shows me all 0's,2016-12-12 13:39:26,2018-09-18 14:38:47,closed,13,vishnuvangala,"268340935 If you select hours, it'll show whatever hours you assigned as estimates to the tasks. Please check how many hours/story points you assigned to the tasks in Jira. 
Regarding your second comment, If you don't select your particular team, it'll aggregate data from other teams in your project, so that's why it shows the points. pxk5958
268441711 @pxk5958 For first comment: If I select hours and it will show the estimated hours assigned for the story/task..then what is the significance of having OPEN , and DONE field. Under what circumstance I can see data in those field?

To the second comment: I have only one Team associated with the project which I have mentioned in the application.properties file. On selecting Team from the dropdown, I was expecting it to show the data related to my Team?
When I don't select any team then in that case it shows data, which is slightly misleading to me.  Mahendra1260
268471849 @pxk5958 @Mahendra1260 
@leahxu  
After changing the value of sEstimate and sEstimateTime now I'm able to see some numbers over there.. what I understood is.. the widget shows the number of sEstimate hours in ""Open""/""WIP"", and it shows only when I select KANBAN but not showing in sprint..  
Even though if I select all teams.. the widgets shows me all 0's. Not sure of what exactly it is happening.. but need a clear understanding of this widget..
 vishnuvangala
268522270 To show scrum sprints you must (1) have the collector property configured, and (2) have a project/team have an active ending sprint. If a sprint exists but has no end date it will be treated as a kanban sprint.
@vishnuvangala as is the case with most of the jira issues reported here the cause has been the jira collector not being correctly configured. Note that if you make a change to the collector config the change will only apply to newly collected jira items. Hence, you may need to wipe your jira data and recollect it.

sEstimate comes from the story point estimates that are put on stories. sEstimateTime comes from time estimates that are put on subtasks of stories. Hours estimates for tasks keep track of the total estimate and how much time has been put into the issue. From these open, wip, and done values can be deduced.

@Mahendra1260 double check your configuration. Note that if a sprint is not active (start date <= now <=(?) end date) it will not show up. If you do not select any team than ""Any team"" is assumed. MarkRx
277277346 @vishnuvangala The feature widget now has an option to display metrics based on the number of tickets instead of estimates. This is for setups that do not use estimates.
Functionality merged in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 Use latest codebase. You’ll also need to follow cleanup instructions provided in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1137 satishc1

What java version? Jira version? Did this happen before the recent jira changes?

@pxk5958  MarkRx
267022168 Hi @MarkRx , @pxk5958 ,
added logging level properties and surprisingly I don't see any errors after restart of JIRA collector.. But still I'm seeing all 0's in open,WIP,Done.. when I verified in ""feature"" table of mongo db.. I can see all the stories/issues with ""open, InProgress & done"" state. For every refresh in widget I can see some issues in progress randomly.. but the count always remains the same to 0.  Not sure what else I'm missing here..

**""What java version? Jira version? Did this happen before the recent jira changes?""**
--> My Java version is **openjdk version ""1.8.0_111""**
--> Jira version is **JIRA v1000.621.2**
--> This is first time I have started my Jira collector. (Infact even Im new to HYGIEIA).

Here is the log after updating above properties.

267035327 I'm not sure what jira v1000.621.2 is. It should be something like 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x.

To get estimates to show up your jira must be configured to have estimates on story points. There is no count of the number of issues currently - #940

You also need to make sure you configured the estimate fields
```properties
feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story
feature.jiraStoryPointsFieldName=customfield_10002
```
There are some trouble shooting steps listed in the readme here: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature/jira MarkRx
267134073 Check what values you have for time/story points estimate. JIRA lets you turn off estimates so it feeds Hygieia nulls for those fields, which then get turned into 0. leahxu

267621181 sEstimate and sEstimateTime are 0, they're populated by story points and time estimates data from JIRA which you likely didn't set. Thus when it aggregates how much time is in each queue it becomes zero. You can confirm by changing the values in your mongodb database to be another number (e.g. 1 and you'll see it reflected on your dashboard) leahxu
268325725 I am seeing the dashboard as below:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3480342/21363644/8a3e5506-c713-11e6-878c-bd6e385da541.png)

Open : 0
WIP:2
Done:0

Although the particular task/story is done.. not sure why it is showing as 0. I have selected 'hours' from the dropdown Mahendra1260
268330443 Also, when I see all the field as 0 if I select ,my project team from the dropdown.
But when i select 'Any' from the dropdown from Team Field.. it starts showing me data as above screenshot Mahendra1260
268340935 If you select hours, it'll show whatever hours you assigned as estimates to the tasks. Please check how many hours/story points you assigned to the tasks in Jira. 
Regarding your second comment, If you don't select your particular team, it'll aggregate data from other teams in your project, so that's why it shows the points. pxk5958
268441711 @pxk5958 For first comment: If I select hours and it will show the estimated hours assigned for the story/task..then what is the significance of having OPEN , and DONE field. Under what circumstance I can see data in those field?

To the second comment: I have only one Team associated with the project which I have mentioned in the application.properties file. On selecting Team from the dropdown, I was expecting it to show the data related to my Team?
When I don't select any team then in that case it shows data, which is slightly misleading to me.  Mahendra1260
268471849 @pxk5958 @Mahendra1260 
@leahxu  
After changing the value of sEstimate and sEstimateTime now I'm able to see some numbers over there.. what I understood is.. the widget shows the number of sEstimate hours in ""Open""/""WIP"", and it shows only when I select KANBAN but not showing in sprint..  
Even though if I select all teams.. the widgets shows me all 0's. Not sure of what exactly it is happening.. but need a clear understanding of this widget..
 vishnuvangala
268522270 To show scrum sprints you must (1) have the collector property configured, and (2) have a project/team have an active ending sprint. If a sprint exists but has no end date it will be treated as a kanban sprint.
@vishnuvangala as is the case with most of the jira issues reported here the cause has been the jira collector not being correctly configured. Note that if you make a change to the collector config the change will only apply to newly collected jira items. Hence, you may need to wipe your jira data and recollect it.

sEstimate comes from the story point estimates that are put on stories. sEstimateTime comes from time estimates that are put on subtasks of stories. Hours estimates for tasks keep track of the total estimate and how much time has been put into the issue. From these open, wip, and done values can be deduced.

@Mahendra1260 double check your configuration. Note that if a sprint is not active (start date <= now <=(?) end date) it will not show up. If you do not select any team than ""Any team"" is assumed. MarkRx
277277346 @vishnuvangala The feature widget now has an option to display metrics based on the number of tickets instead of estimates. This is for setups that do not use estimates.

After I moved to the latest version of Jira-Collector with a seems-to-be mandatory Team plugin, all new-added data in my jira is not retrieved into mongodb even I set some fake field in config file for the team.
My Jira does not have that plugin and no plan to install it.
However we'd like to use the new function of the stastics in Issue.
Could you help on this?

269022585 @amitmawkin would you be able to manually trigger another build? i can't replicate the failure and it is occurring in a module that wasn't altered as part of this pull request.

i seem to recall seeing an issue with this test in another pull request previously? mdavis40
269022658 @mdskd  let me trigger one
 amitmawkin
269023603 thanks @amitmawkin, looks good. i am pretty certain i've seen that test fail before, perhaps it warrants an issue to see if anything can be done to address the flakiness? mdavis40
269023902 LGTM amitmawkin
269340459 @rob-miller-777 @mdskd @Bradmoon After merging this, I am seeing on my local machine that the searchable dropdown boxes are not working. For example, the build widget dropdown with a large dataset doesn't work. But it works when I revert this PR locally. Are you seeing the same behavior ?  satishc1
269347341 @satishc1 we will investigate this today/tomorrow. mdavis40
269348281 @mdskd Thanks Matt.  As an fyi, I also tried locally building the code with PR 1049 on top off the latest master (which has PR 1027). But the effect was the same... the build widget with a large dataset was unresponsive. satishc1
269526149 still investigating @satishc1  mdavis40
269531897 @mdskd Thanks Matt. If you are able to recreate the issue and feel it will take long to resolve this, please let me know and we can revert the PR. Thanks for your help on this. satishc1
269549639 @satishc1 definitely experiencing the same

on master with ~10,000 jenkins jobs, the ui-select basically crashes the browser. reverting the merge, with the same list of jenkins jobs, the ui-select responds (albeit slowly)

finding root cause is going to be a bit time-consuming. let's revert for now and we'll dig into the issue. our additional 2 PRs that are closely related (pagination on the API and client) resolve the performance concerns, but as we discuss it more it feels as tho it is just masking the underlying problem.

sincere apologies for the inconvenience
 mdavis40
269551633 this appear to be a related [issue](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select/issues/88) mdavis40
269572592 @mdskd Not a problem. Thank you for researching it. Will revert the PR for now. satishc1
269791665 we should have some direction on how we intend to address this early next week. i'd like to discuss it with our team before making a decision. folks should all be back on Tuesday.

thanks! mdavis40
270228019 it looks like we are going to combine this PR with the client-side pagination PR we've also got queued up. paging alleviates the performance concerns, additionally a different directive is utilized in that pull request.

we'll get this opened as soon as we can this week.

_note_: it is dependent upon this [PR](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1049)

thanks! mdavis40
270229182 @mdskd @nireeshT Thanks Matt. We'll take a look at https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1049 satishc1

266450567 No problem.  Unfortunately I can't provide the same support for Jira, I haven't worked with that one at all since we don't actually have Jira here.  Let me know if you have any other gitlab questions though.   rob-miller-777
266965934 Thanks @rob-miller-777 ,
    One quick question regarding git-lab is.. I dont see the widget getting updated automatically.. we are performing some commits on project and I have set the cron job property as 1min in my git-lab.properties file. But still I dont see them updated in widget.. Unless I click on edit and click on save.. then I'm able to see the updated results there.. any idea? vishnuvangala
267046759 If you refresh the page, do you see the new data?  The dashboard and the collector are on different timers.  So even if the collector retrieves new data, you won't see it on the dashboard until the dashboard refreshes what it has by calling the UI.  If you don't see the data when you refresh the page, but you do see it when you update the configuration of the widget, my guess would be that you are running into a bug I found.  It seems like there is an issue with all widgets where if you have the same widget running for the same data on multiple dashboards, and one dashboard is either deleted, or removes that widget, it will disable that widget on all dashboards that widget is on.  So for example in Gitlab, if DashboardA and DashboardB both have an SCM widget looking at GitlabRepo1.  If DashboardB is either deleted, or changes that widget to look at GitlabRepo2, it will also disable it for DashboardA.   rob-miller-777
266026226 I'm guessing you don't have the latest changes.  The port and protocol support was only merged into master 3 days ago.  Have you pulled the new code since then? rob-miller-777

[],Fixes the dashboard sometimes not showing data right away due to a timing issue. I think it has to do with the order the asynchronous rest calls come back in. This wraps the setTeamData method into a $timeout function which puts it at the end of the event queue and causes a $scope.$apply() to be run after it is finished. I don't know if the $timeout wrap is necessary (as opposed to using $scope.$apply() but that is what other js functions do so I followed suit.,194168358,1021,Fix for product dashboard sometimes not displaying data right away #864,2016-12-07 21:02:01,2018-09-18 14:38:47,closed,8,MarkRx,"269324634 Be sure that there actually is data to display.

[],"Added configurable pipeline stage names. Backwards compatible. Allows for more and different stage names. Also allows users to hide the Commit and Build stages.

Stage config defaults to:

> systemConfig.systemStages=${CONFIG_GLOBAL_SYSTEM_STAGES:-Commit,Build,DEV,QA,INT,PERF,PROD}

Assumptions:
- There is at most one ""commit"" stage and one ""build"" stage
- Users will not have more than 9 stages including build/commit (the UI column widths are not dynamic due to grids and I didn't see a need to make it dynamic)

279045840 I see a number of issues:

- There are lingering references and logic referring to the System stages in the api settings. If any arbitrary stage can be created (as it seems is this case with the changes) then these need to be removed. If not then the UI needs to be tightened to make names of stages aliases to set system stages.
- There needs to be a way of having deterministic ordering on environment stages. This is needed in pipeline computations (such as finding the last stage a pipeline was in). If the intent is to remove the set global system stages then you will have to store ordering in the widget. The code as it is right now is not going to properly compute pipeline metrics (the mappings map in the widget has no intrinsic ordering). You should not rely on using a specific implementation (LinkedHashMap)
- I don't think getCommitsAfterStage was modified correctly.
- My product dashboard is still computing based on the system stages set. If the intent is for any team to have any arbitrary stages then this needs to have some kind of computation to determine the stages to display MarkRx

271382429 @MarkRx We are thinking that this should be configurable on the UI itself - per Dashboard. The solution should simply be 
1. Have the Env name an editable text box/label. 
2. Mapped environment can still remain drop down.
3. Save it as options of the widget itself. 

No api changes needed. All on the UI. 
Thoughts? tabladrum
271436533 That would not be enough. It wouldn't allow N number of stages (in our case we have 6 not 5). If we were to allow each team to have a different number of stages the product dashboard becomes a problem. MarkRx

278477352 @MarkRx  - Take a look at https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/pr-1020

1) Changed pipeline widget modal to configure custom stage names.
2) Select production environment while configuring stage names.
3) Dynamic display of product dashboard with customized stage names for each dashboard.
4) Eliminate the duplicate entry of team dashboards in product dashboard.

[],"When we serve the UI with gulp serve (without nginx), the interaction synchronization through [ghostMode](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options#option-ghostMode) option causes problems. It is not working as intended and browsers end up in different pages sometimes and cause problems during testing. For example, we consistently end up in a scenario where one browser goes into a dashboard page whereas another browser remains in the home page (site.html), and eventually interactions trigger the deleteDashboard() javascript function on the latter browser. We consistently get a dashboard deleted when the Monitor widget's configure wheel button is clicked in the first browser. That is not the only case where dashboards get deleted though.

So the question is, was ghostMode intended to be used? If not, we could turn it off in gulpfile.js when initializing browser-sync, since it's causing the dashboards to be deleted during testing, which is rather annoying.

[],"I have been working on a Rundeck collector which creates EnvironmentComponent deploy records.  I have a couple questions about the implementation:

1. I could use the Rundeck post-completion webhook to send records to a collector or build a collector from the API to run on a cron schedule, as the Github collector does. Is there a preferred approach?  Could I build the Rundeck post-completion webhook feature into the api itself, while also building a separate collector that runs on a cron schedule?
2. When building separate collectors, is it preferred to use the api endpoints to create mongo objects or do the collectors generally have their own `Repository` bean with a connection to the mongo db directly?

I created two PRs that I will be depending on for the implementation #1007 and #1005.  If these are not yet resolved, I would ask that we begin discussion there and then talk about the implementation here.

We are keeping both webhook and collector approaches - since different users will have different requirements etc. I am reviewing the PRs.  tabladrum
