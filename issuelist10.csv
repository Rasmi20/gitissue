[],"The deployment POST endpoint does not align with the way that the data is displayed in a number of ways:

1. The jobUrl property is completely ignored (search for references to  DeployDataCreateRequest::getJobUrl() in IDE).  There should be an option to access the job URL component by component.
2. The `appName`/`instanceUrl` property pair is being defined as distinct in the backend [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DeployServiceImpl.java#L242) because the query looks to match the options passed in.  This means that two collectors can be created with the same name, which then appears as the same name in the Deploy widget dropdown.
3. The environmentUrl doesn't get set in the [createEnvComponent](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DeployServiceImpl.java#L248) method.  This means that jobs submitted by the POST endpoint do not have a functional ""View in Jenkins"" link, as this is captured by the `environment.url` property [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/detail.html#L25)

My suggested solution:
1. `jobUrl` property gets set on the environment_component collection object, then if this value is set it is used by the [deploy detail modal](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/deploy/detail.html).  It will need to be at the component level, as the `jobUrl` property is specifying a deploy URL for a component.
2. Make `applicationName` distinct in the CollectorItem repo by removing `option.put(""instanceUrl"", request.getInstanceUrl());` from [DeployServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DeployServiceImpl.java).  I realize this would be a breaking change for those with duplicate records here already by `applicationName` and `instanceUrl`.  I don't know what the project stance on this issue would be.
3. The `environmentUrl` should be set by the `instanceUrl` that is available in the API object.

This will not work in all cases. It is perfectly valid to have the same application name on different instances and these would in turn be different logical items.  MarkRx
264982903 @MarkRx Then the `Environment.java` file needs to change as well as the view for choosing Deployment collectors, as right now the instanceUrl is not included in the display for choosing the collector.  The environment being tested for equality based only on the `appName` property means that I cannot create a map keyed on the `Environment` when there are two records with the same app name.

If you have another solution that allows these multiple instanceUrls in a way that makes it easy to work with, I'm definitely interested in working through this.  We could set a time to discuss on the gitter chat for this project if you are interested. jmcshane

What are you trying to accomplish? If you have the same application spread vertically across different instances (instances meaning deployment tools) look at #891.

In the collector model there is a single collector that defines N number of URLs and niceNames. Each collectorItem refers to the collector and has applicationName, instanceUrl (in options) and 'niceName' set. If the collectorItem has 'niceName' set the UI will differentiate entries using that.

If you send in niceName through the rest endpoint it should differentiate items in the UI for you. Look at https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/891#issuecomment-260472065 for an example. Doing so would allow you to be able to distinguish between two applications with the same name.

I also encountered the same issue and solve to follow below steps: 
1. Point mongoDb directory:
    ```
    mongod --dbpath < path to the data directory>
    ```
2. Create database 
    ```
    mongo
    MongoDB shell version: 3.0.4
    connecting to: test  
    > use dashboarddb
    switched to db dashboarddb 
    > db.createUser({
        user: ""dashboarduser"",
        pwd: ""dbpassword"",
        roles: [
          { role: ""readWrite"", db: ""dashboard"" }
        ]
      })
    ```
    Output similar to below should be seen in your mongo shell
    ```  
    Successfully added user: {
      ""user"" : ""dashboarduser"",
      ""roles"" : [
        {
          ""role"" : ""readWrite"",
          ""db"" : ""dashboard""
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Give DB credentials and port properly in you dashboard.properties then
    ```
    java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties
    ``` elangesk
264386166 @vishnuvangala @elangesk 
If you use dashboarddb then the role would be
```js
{ role: ""readWrite"", db: ""dashboarddb"" }
```
instead of 
```js
{ role: ""readWrite"", db: ""dashboard"" } 
```
And the corresponding properties file should have
```properties
dbname=dashboarddb
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=dbpassword

Finally I could resolve this authentication issue but unable to access the api even after starting with below command.. not sure what went wrong.. but able to authenticate successfully with below command... 
But I have a quick question...
In order to setup Hygieia, should I run API, UI and mongoDB mandatorly in docker container? or can I also start with normal commands instead of running in docker container? Please suggest. I see some difficulty while running through docker and even in setting up this HYGIEIA.. if someone could help me in setting up through chat/live.. that would be great.

**Modified command used to run api using docker which resolved the mongo authentication issue:**
```
docker run \
  -t \
  -p 8082:8082 \
  -v /logs:/hygieia/logs \
  -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=192.168.XX.XXX"" \
  -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT=27017"" \
  -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE=dashboarddb"" \
  -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_USERNAME=dashboarduser"" \
  -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD=dbpassword"" \
  -i hygieia-api:latest
``` vishnuvangala
264724930 Glad to see your issue is resolved.

Docker is not required in order to run Hygieia - please see the setup instructions for the respective layer of Hygieia that you are trying to run:
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/Setup.md

ie. for the API layer, you should be able to do:
```bash
mvn install
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties
``` mrpudn
264774808 @mrpudn,
Yeah.. I understood that Docker is not mandatory after reviewing the document again. Looks like the setup document was messedup and confusing for the beginners who setup HYGIEIA.

Seriously, it was so simple to setup.. now, Im encountering with a different issue.. Unable to login to portal.. running the api on 8082 port.. looks like Im missing something.. If required I will raise a different issue.

1. Rebuild core using 1.7 and do mvn clean install on your laptop. This will put 1.7 compiled version of core in your local maven repo. You will need to comment out the lines that are 1.8 features. See the compilation errors and comment out those lines. 
2. Rebuild Jenkins plugin. This time this should use the core jar from local maven repo.  tabladrum

Is there another 1.8 features to comment out? I have commented :

``` ci-t
266901241 Action 2 was what worked for me. You just have to change the target to 1.7 in two places. 

Also, just commented out any of the 1.8 java code in the core module (pretty much anything that used lambdas). which was just the stuff in CommitEventListener.java and it's corresponding test. senatori

264259362 What about all of the collectors? MarkRx
264263826 @MarkRx good question. So as far as the collectors that we're using go, the property that requires encryption is the database password.
Since the API's Docker file defines ENV SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD, that is what's been encrypted. This env variable then gets picked up by the other collectors through the docker link to the API via $HYGIEIA_API_ENV_SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD.

Let me know if you mean something else. Thanks! Mpluya
264756111 I am very interested in this feature as well and would want it to be available for all Spring Boot apps within the project.  I think with what @Mpluya has provided (with the jasypt library as a core dependency), the `@EnableEncryptableProperties` just needs to be added to each collector.

The argument `jasypt.encryptor.password` can be provided in the `spring.config.location` property file, so it can be called out along with the other configuration parameters in each of the collector `README.md` files.  Then, there would not be a need to have updates to any of the Dockerfiles as it just sits with the other properties. jmcshane
264759834 @Mpluya I created a PR to your project in StateFarmIns to add these properties and a callout in each section of the README documentation, see StateFarmIns/Hygieia#4 jmcshane
264867297 @jmcshane you are correct.  Enabling property encryption on the collectors is just a matter of adding the @EnableEncryptableProperties annotation to the Application class on each collector. I did not add it by default to all the collectors, since I would like property encryption to be added on an as needed basis. I don't want an additional post processor kicking off on startup of each collector if there are no encrypted properties to deal with. I'm open to having it turned on on every collector if thats what we all agree to do. 

As for your pull request, I really appreciate you taking the time to enable property encryption on all collectors. I'd like for folks to weigh in before we put this in. 
As for putting the secret key (jasypt.encryptor.password) as another property, I would have to disagree with this approach. I would prefer for the secret key to be passed in either as a system property or environment variable when starting up your spring boot app. In my opinion, having an encrypted property and next to it is the secret key - pretty much gives away the the decrypted value. That said, in my organization when we startup Hygieia via docker containers, the secret key gets served up from a secure variable in our gitlab ci runner. 

I look forward to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you again. Mpluya
264896583 @Mpluya after thinking this over a little more, you are definitely right about not having the `jasypt.encryptor.password` property in the property file itself.

I think we just need to call this out explicitly in each of the `README.md` files and then, as you say, update the `Dockerfile` for each collector.

I'll make a modification to the PR I sent to remove the callout of the password in the properties and modify the above documentation section to talk about the system property.

[],"Currently the Hygieia pipeline is hard coded to use at most 5 stages in the order of DEV > QA > INT > PERF > PROD. We have found that this approach does not satisfy all pipelines. 

I propose the following enhancements:

- (A) Custom stage names with a configurable number of system level stages. Some teams may use more than one level of integration environments. So the pipeline would become DEV > QA > INT1 > INT2 > PERF > PROD
- ~~(B) Configurable order of stages - Some teams use different staging orders. For example PERF testing might come at different locations in the pipeline.~~ System stage groups should be generic enough to work for all teams. I think keeping order consistent will simplify aggregation and metrics a bunch.
- (C) Multiple environments per stage - There may be parallel environments within a stage. For example, suppose there are 3 independent QA environments - qa1, qa2, and qa3. Components may go to any QA in any order. They must go to at least one QA before moving to a higher environment.

(A) is simply a matter of refactoring and adding functionality. (B) and (C) add flexibility at the cost of complexity.

Each team dashboard would be able to define which system level stages to use ~~along with the order that they are used in their pipeline~~. Grouping would also be definable so that N number of environments may be part of the same stage. The UI would have to be updated to display this information.

Product dashboards would have to change to take into account multiple environments per stage. In the case of a team having multiple environments per a stage the earliest date a PipelineCommit is seen in any of the environments in the stage would be used for calculations. 

## Examples
Given a system stage config of DEV, QA, INT1, INT2, PERF, PROD:

| Pipeline | DEV | QA            | INT1 | INT2 | PERF | PROD |
|----------|------|------------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| APP A   | dev1 | qa1 | int-a  | int-main | p1 | prod |
| APP B   | dev1 | qa1 / qa2 | int-a  | int-main | p2 | prod |
| APP C   |         | qa1 |   | int-main | p2 | prod |

Observe that App B has multiple parallel environments defined for the 'QA' stage.

[],"Hi! 

I need to generate the Jenkins plugin and the plugin should be compiled with the same version of Java that Jenkins is using, in my case java7, but the plugin depends of the “core” project of Hygieia and it uses some features that are only present in Java 8 ( Lamda functions ).
So, there is a way to compile or generate jenkins plugin to run in java7 or just it won't work? 

Thank you! ",191534129,979,Build broken in Jenkins plugin with java7 due core dependency,2016-11-24 14:34:22,2018-09-18 14:38:43,closed,2,mqglobant,"263269266 Hygieia requires java 8. You could always run jenkins with a java 8 runtime and see if it functions properly.

Technically you could make a java 7 build by removing the CommitEventListener class as it seems to be the only item in core that requires java 8 features. No guarantees it will work as dependent libraries may require java 8 as well.
 MarkRx
263271945 Right now upgrade Jenkins to run in Java8 is not an option, it has a lot of plugins and there is a lot of people using it , so we can't risk to let Jenkins broken while we test ... I'll try to test in some other instance of Jenkins but it'll requiere a license (It's the cloudbee version) ...
Thanks anyway for your time :)

Changes:

- Jira collector now supports gathering team data. In the past Jira projects were being placed into 'scope' and 'ScopeOwner' (in collector_items). Now if the tempo team field is configured in the collector the team data is placed in 'ScopeOwner'. 
- Feature widget can filter based on project name, team name, or both. To grab all items for a given field / team the 'Any' option can be selected in the drop down.
- Feature widget can be configured to list Epics (previously called 'features') or Issues (stories, defects, spikes, etc).
- Added hyperlinks to epics / issues in progress
- Added hyperlink to sprint in progress
- Issues that have been completed now have a strikethrough on the UI
- Issues are sorted by modified date. Epics are still sorted by points. We feel that when listing stories a user will be more interested in recent activity.
- Feature widget modified to display open / in progress / done estimate metrics instead of total / in progress / done as this seems to be more intuitive.
- Added the ability to collect data on multiple issues types in the Jira collector
- Improved documentation / configuration of jira collector - renamed 'feature.jiraIssueTypeId' to 'feature.jiraIssueTypeNames'

Note: the feature collection will have to be wiped / reset in order to take advantage of urls and teams

The jira collector items that correspond to scopeowners will have to be wiped as they currently store project information

@tabladrum @amitmawkin we need to know how to construct urls to versionone assets in order to have hyperlinks be available for the version one feature.

How can I tackle this ?

305870485 @Gurugit1  - did you try giving your team name (or any team name)  in input field, it should start suggesting the values. If not check in your Mongo if team collection is populated. nireeshT
305886383 @nireeshT - I could see data in feature collection but team collection is empty.
I'm using the following properties. 

feature.queryFolder=jiraapi-queries
feature.storyQuery=story
feature.epicQuery=epic

feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story
feature.jiraSprintDataFieldName=customfield_10000
feature.jiraEpicIdFieldName=customfield_10002
feature.jiraStoryPointsFieldName=customfield_10003
feature.jiraTeamFieldName=

Do I need any other property ? Gurugit1
263275711 I recommend someone doing a quick sanity test with versionone with this branch to verify these changes did not break it. They shouldn't as they are view changes that work off the underlying data model but we don't have any way here to verify that. MarkRx
266150717 @MarkRx versionone testing looks good so far. Testing more. One thing is would be nice to have: (1) Filter in selectable Teams based on project selected and (2) Filter in selectable project based on Team selected. May be I will open up an issue separately to do this.

Question: Do you see a project tree path based on org hierarchy in JIRA? Something like this: Company->Line of Business -> Product -> Team etc? tabladrum

266335850 What does the team mean in Jira ? 
Seems our Jira does not have the API


Added:
And I found that no data was imported after this exception, even the log said is loaded.
The dashboards show nothing, and the corresponding issue is not found in mongodb.

Based on that section of the stack trace, my guess is you didn't include a cron sequence in your properties file, or an invalid one.  Makes sure you having something like the line below in your application properties file.  
`gitlab.cron=0 0/1 * * * *` rob-miller-777
262887205 Thanks for you help after i changed my gitlab.cron i didn't that issue but  i'm getting below issue
 It's trying to fetch the gitlab details form default gitlab url not for my specified ipaddress url. If i give gitlab.host in gitlab.properties i'm getting message  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid character ':' for HOST_IPV4 in ""http://66.228.26.201:8282/"".But if try with gitlab.server in gitlab.properties file its started but fetching form default not mine.
gitlab.properties file:
```properties
dbname=dashboarddb
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=dbpassword
dbhost=127.0.0.1
dbport=27017
gitlab.cron=0 0/1 * * * *
gitlab.server=http://66.228.26.201:8282/ (Sample one not exact ip address)
gitlab.branche=master
gitlab.apiToken=CAvxoN_MByFws4MQKxZ2
gitlab.saveLog=true
```
gitlab jar Command:
```bash
sudo java -jar gitlab-git-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=gitlab --spring.config.location=/home/ubuntu/Hygieia-master/collectors/scm/gitlab/target/gitlab.properties
```

263285435 Think you are now at the same point as #957 , I will be working on a fix for that this week.  Your properties file does need to be updated however.  Server, branche, and saveLog are no longer properties.  Instead use the properties below.  I will be adding two new properties for port and protocol to support the issue in 957.  

```properties
gitlab.cron=0 0/3 * * * *
gitlab.apiToken={token}
gitlab.host={host}
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false

That said, I found jasypt-spring-boot (Jasypt integration for Spring boot). It boot straps a Spring post processor which makes the app aware of the encrypted properties. Details about jasypt-spring-boot is here https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot.

Step4: Build api package using dashboard.properties files

264726438 Docker is not required in order to run Hygieia.

For example, to install and start the API:
```bash
mvn install
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties
```
I've been able to get Hygieia running on Linux following the same [Setup instructions](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/Setup.md).

If you encounter a specific error while trying to install and run the project on Linux, please feel free to open a new issue with logs and a description of your problem.

[],"Currently the Hygieia product allows users to create accounts, and then stores the passwords to those accounts in Mongo. This PR adds a new authentication service that can be used for LDAP based authentication to gain access to Hygieia. It uses an existing LDAP server implemeted by the deploying organization to check if an account merely exists. It has not been tested against group level access, but by modifying the dn in the application.properties file, more fine-grain restrictions should be able to be enforced (see README).

LDAP authentication can be activated through the ""ldapAuth"" spring profile, and setup instructions have been added to the api README.

How does one turn this on or off using configuration in the docker files and docker-compose?
 MarkRx
261376738 I was unaware of there being admin functionality without these changes. Based on that assumption, this was not designed to support admin users.
To run with LDAP, the Dockerfile CMD for the API would be changed to say
`java -jar ....... --spring.profiles.active=ldapAuth` 

Running without LDAP is the default behavior.

 amitmawkin
261384839 Thanks @amitmawkin , I will take a look at how to incorporate that feature into my changes. Does the admin 'group' only get those two extra actions?
 brennanananan
261411293 Also, it seems you're assuming the usernames will be stored under uid. It may not be so and needs to be configurable as a search filter.

[Referrals](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/ldap/referral/jndi.html) also need to be handled.

I encountered these issues with my organization's LDAP when working on this.
 pxk5958
261556709 - You need to change the docker properties builder so that no rebuild is necessary to be able to use LDAP
- The ""sign up"" feature needs to be hidden if ldap is enabled
- The ""sign up"" api call needs to throw an exception if ldap is enabled
- I would prefer reusing the existing auth controller and just checking a property dynamically to see if LDAP is enabled instead of using a spring profile. You can stick it into the systemConfig property map for now that is part of API. In the future we may want to build a System Config UI that can change these values and store them into the database. Using spring profiles prevents dynamic property changes without a restart.
- For now as a work around if the username is ""admin"" log in using the old mechanism. If not use ldap. A admin entry would have to be created in the database manually since the signup will be disabled if ldap is enabled (or create the admin user first then disable ldap). User roles could be added in the future.
 MarkRx
263636860 @brennanananan any update on @MarkRx comments and the admin user? Let me know if you need extra hands. tabladrum
263643735 @tabladrum I agree with the comments that @MarkRx supplied, however I currently do not have the bandwidth to work on them.

I have the up-to-date code (from 4 days ago) and have been able to build the UI and API, but cannot get the Gitlab SCM collector to work properly.  My major error begins with

`Error creating bean with name 'gitlabSettings': Could not bind properties to [unknown]`

I'm running this off of docker images, I did not want to do this locally:

> application.properties
```

261436421 Hi MarkRx, thanks for the update and considering this as valuable feature. In the dashboard we are trying to get more additional information by drilling down into the respective tools (JIRA, Jenkins, Stash..) using links. If possible try to consider this one.

I am not sure it will be good or not to ask you this question, By when we can expect this feature in production (PR), I am asking this question because our budget is getting over in 3-4 weeks and also I want to set the expectations to my mgmt.

Thanks in Advance.

After installing Hotfix, I ran ""mongod --dbpath command"" and it is stopped at ""**waiting for connection on port 27017**""

```
So, after doing some googling, I have **kept that command window in the same state and opened new command window** and ran ""**mongo**"" command then the previous window, where i ran mongodb --dbpath command was showing ""2016-12-05T10:18:14.361-0500 I NETWORK  [initandlisten] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:1217 #1 (1 connection now open)""

but the issue is,, if i closed the 2nd command window the connection is closing.

**is this fine?**

By keeping these 2 windows open, i have ran next step, i.e. executing the ""java -jar api.jar ....."" command it shown following error
```

**any solution for this?** or am I missing something

please do the needful knagendrak
264885042 @knagendrak May I know what you are trying to do exactly? It seems to be behaving as it should. [mongod](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/) handles the data requests. [mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/) is a shell interface to MongoDB, so it connects to your mongo database and gets disconnected when you close it as it should.  pxk5958
264886115 Actually i am trying to follow the steps to install this Hygieia dashboard.
as part of it installed MongoDB and then followed next step to API
in API section when I ran ""java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties"" i got the Timeout exception as shown below...

More details about this can be read from features.md file.

This is still a WIP, we will be adding some more configuration and capabilities to this

What UCD version you are using?
I think its issue with UCD version 6.2.x... as current uDeploy collector is not compatible with  that version.

277284593 @smsuresh The feature widget now has an option to display metrics based on the number of tickets instead of estimates. This is for setups that do not use estimates.
Functionality merged in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 Use latest codebase. You’ll also need to follow cleanup instructions provided in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1137 satishc1

260944867 Your API / UI / Jira collector must not be configured correctly. Ensure they are pointing to the same database, using the correct ports, and the data actually exists.
 MarkRx
261157116 Thanks, JIRA was storing data in ""dashboard"" db where as all other components had the db as ""dashboarddb""  -- BUT  why JIRA alone picking different DB when I configure for dashboarddb? can you pls calrify.
 smsuresh
261159355 Can you clarify the purpose  of switches    ||      &  >>   under features..
It keep changing data, irrespective whether I pause or make it run.
 smsuresh
261244041 The database defaults in different documents might be out of sync.

I suggest grabbing the latest code for jira. It allows configuration of the sprint type which might be what you want.
 MarkRx
265564232 @smsuresh  - did @MarkRx  suggestion help you fix the issue.  nireeshT
277284593 @smsuresh The feature widget now has an option to display metrics based on the number of tickets instead of estimates. This is for setups that do not use estimates.
Functionality merged in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 Use latest codebase. You’ll also need to follow cleanup instructions provided in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1137 satishc1

Whenever I create a new dashboard or try to view sample dashboards, it always display's Topo's Dashboard, which looks like a team dashboard.

What I did is simply trick getSprintEstimates() to return the issue count in the SprintEstimate object where I get the issue count, as what hours/sp do, inside the switch case statements in file FeatureServiceImpl.java

As we seldom have the usage for Hours/sp in jira, I just did kind of hard-code to return only issue count.

[],"Adds ability to configure a regular expression to indicate environments that can ignore errors. If an environment ignores errors the UI will use a gray icon instead of a red one. The deploy widget will only turn red if an environment that is not ignoring errors fails.

Use case: There are cases when we don't care if an environment is down. In a blue/green stage-active deployment we never care about the ""staging"" environment. Without this change the deploy widget will almost always be red (as usually no code is staged).

We don't want the same regex affecting every user or we don't want to change the properties file everytime there is a new regex.

Thoughts?

Can you run the collector with logging level debug and post the log.  Are you certain the credentials to the repo that you have saved are right ?  Just to troubleshoot, you could save an invalid password and see what shows up in the log ..and then save the right password and see what shows up in the log.

262024236 I've actually been wondering the same thing. Been building a feature collector for gitlab issue boards, and I can't seem to figure out the purpose of the scope repository.  rob-miller-777
262026140 I am taking another look at it right now for a different reason. I think the scope collection may be very specific for VersionOne. Will confirm. tabladrum
262026445 @tabladrum Versionone stores project information in Scope repository but doesn't use it.

262032581 @MarkRx @pxk5958 @tabladrum I am forming a view that we need to separate widgtes in UI for VersionOne and Jira. Our goal always have been for UI to have a tool agnostic domain model , looks like with Jira and Version One it might not be possible. 

thoughts? amitmawkin
262035717 @amitmawkin Currently, we have been able to add new features as well in a tool agnostic manner. They both have projects, teams, sprints, issues/stories and epics right? Is there anything specific I am missing that made you form that view? pxk5958
262037221 Lets  stick to tool agnostic nature of Hygieia. tabladrum
262038563 I'm not too worried about the UI as the differences between the two are minimal. Should they become a painpoint then it could be addressed then.

In fact I don't think it is necessary for them to diverge. Right now they only do so in one place I think MarkRx

256167355 @anchatho We actually ran into similar issues when trying to use the gitlab collector.  It turns out there are quite a few hard coded values throughout the code, and settings that don't get used. I have actually been working on a pretty substantial rewrite of the gitlab collector which I intend to open a pull request for in the coming days that should help you out.  Right now we are going through the process of reviewing the CLA and signing it before we can actually contribute back.  Here is a link to the branch I intend to open a pull request for in case you were interested.  https://github.com/StateFarmIns/Hygieia/tree/gitlabEnhancements

However this url works fine directly in my browser. Could you guide us to to the correct solution ?

BTW, this is a private repo, and I notice that the there is an API Key input in the UI dialog. Could you let me know where I could get it?

Thanks in advance!
 xpdable
261548597 To get the API key, just go to your profile settings in Gitlab.  Click the Access Tokens tab, and create a token there.  This token will represent you, so it has access to all private repos that you do.  That seems to be the problem you are having right now.  If that doesn't fix the issue, let me know and we can look at it more.

255410620 I don't believe there's a way to do this via the UI.

You can use the `mongo` shell to modify users - just connect to the database and modify the user in the `authentication` collection.

Users look like this:

```
{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""...""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.Authentication"",
    ""username"" : ""..."",
    ""password"" : ""...""
}
```
 mrpudn
255589288 @anurag111527 @mrpudn As suggested above you could change the username via mongo shell or using a client like RoboMongo. For the password, you could create a new account with the password you want, then replace the existing one with the hash of the new one.
 satishc1
255804761 I dint quiet understand. When I sign up in Hygiea dashboard, where would the login credentials be stored. And also if I would liketo see how many  users have signed up, where can I see that information.
Thanks
 anurag111527
255805940 Login credentials are stored in the `authentication` collection in MongoDB.

You can list the number of users from the `mongo` shell:

```
db.authentication.count()
```
 mrpudn
255806558 thankyou for your swift response. I tried to do that using mongo shell and I get ""11"" @mrpudn mrpudn

256030689 yes. I tried using db.getUsers() and it gives me only 2 users on that db. is there any other way that I can get the list of the other user. 
Thanks!!
 anurag111527
256035551 `db.getUsers()` will give you the **MongoDB** users.
`db.authentication.find()` will give you the **Hygieia** users.

Following the below step have generated a secret key and updated the respective properties file. Look like this also did not help..

From module core generate a secret key.

```

Add this generated key to api.properties

``` properties
    key=

    Add the same key to your repo settings file.

[],"Fix for #678. Backwards compatible. Adds the ability to configure a widget to interpret sprints as either kanban, scrum, or both. This is necessary since it is not possible to deduce which sprint type a project uses from the rest api. I also did some code cleanup while there. The basic issue with the current code is that it interpreted features without sprints as being KANBAN which is not true in all use cases.

Here is how it works:
In order to be considered part of the sprint the feature must not be deleted and must have an ""active"" sprint asset state if the sprint is set. The following logic also applies:

A feature is part of a scrum sprint if any of the following are true:
- the feature has a sprint set that has start <= now <= end and end < EOT (9999-12-31T59:59:59.999999)

A feature is part of a kanban sprint if any of the following are true:
- the feature does not have a sprint set
- the feature has a sprint set that does not have an end date
- the feature has a sprint set that has an end date >= EOT (9999-12-31T59:59:59.999999)

Note the above are mutually exclusive.

Observe how this handles all of the following use cases:
- Typical scrums (a sprint is live for X number of weeks)
- Kanban without any sprints assigned
- Kanban using a sprint without an end date
- Kanban that was set from previous code that interpretted not having a sprint set as being KANBAN (since we use EOT in the queries above)
- Scrum & Kanban (don't see how this is a real world use case but it works similar to the previous code. Kanban will interpret backlog items as being part of kanban but that issue is existing and cannot be resolved due to lack of information)
- The code in the versionone widget that interprets sprints that have an end date > some cutoff as being KANBAN. This works as it will not end up setting the sprint data which causes the feature to be interpreted as kanban

Hi

When I run the Bitbucket collector it is automatically embedding ""projects/repo"" in middle of the URL, so I am getting 404 URL not found error.

My private Bitbucket URL is:
https://bitbucket.company.com/projects/PDC/repos/browse/.gitignore/commits?until=develop&limit=25

But the below URL is verified after executing collector to check for the commit so I am getting 404 not found error.

https://bitbucket.company.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/projects/repos/PDC/repos/browse/.gitignore/commits?until=develop&limit=25

URL embedded in between:
1./rest/api/1.0
2./projects/repo
The above stated is added in between my private URL. Please help me should I need to modify any file to rectify this error.

 oshingc
254542756 Your props file above has this line..
git.key=(dont know what to put here)
1. From module core generate a secret key.
   java -jar <path-to-jar>/core-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
2. Add this generated key to api.properties
   ### api.properties
   key=<your-generated-key>
3. Add the same key to your repo settings file.
   ### git.properties
   git.key=<your-generated-key>
 satishc1
254544361 @oshingc 
First generate a key using this.

``` bash
java -jar /core-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
```

Then add this key to the 2 properties files.

In api.properties the line should look like

``` properties
key=yourgeneratedkey
```

In git.properties the line should look like

``` properties
git.key=yourgeneratedkey
```

I followed the steps, happily now the UI don't stuck at 'Error Encrypting Password', the userID and password are saved in MongoDB but now I have errors at BitBucket Collector.

255590701 @dinukool To setup password based authentication setup 
Refer to the ""Encryption for private repos"" section in the UI module readme.
@sivamadhankumar The log you have pasted shows INFO. The collector runs per the cron schedule that you setup in the properties file...ie it runs over and over and tries to collect.

Here are a few things you could try:
- Double check this property. It should be a string despite its name. It needs to be renamed:
  > feature.jiraIssueTypeId=Story
- Decrease the page size
- See if you can get a response using http REST. Example:

Another suggestion for 
org.apache.http.nio.reactor.ssl.SSLIOSession.receiveEncryptedData(SSLIOSession.java:340) ~

Is your jira using a self-signed SSL cert ? Check if your logs have any SSL cert exceptions. Try starting up the jira collector with -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<yourtruststore> where <yourtruststore> is file containing the public key of your cert.
Refer https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/335

 I wonder why after running curl jira collector worked?
Do I have to run that command always at the beginning of using a JIRA REST API?

253961690 The collector should read from its `src/main/resources/application.properties` file - you can try changing the `dbhost` property there. If it doesn't exist, you should be able to create it based on the example in the collector's `README.md`.
 mrpudn
253961841 Thank you once again. I changed the property from there too. It Did not
help. One thing I noticed is in core you have a Mongodb.java where the host
parameters is assigned with local host. Currently I don't have access to
the system on which I have the logs.

For the UI module set the proxypass directive in apache to point to wherever your api module is running.

ProxyPass /api http://localhost:8080/api

To find out where the api module is running ...
If you have logging set, you should see something like the following line when the api module is started up.

Use case: We have multiple deployment servers that are split up by function. One handles prod and prod-like environments. The other handles test, qa, and dev environments. Data gathered from multiple servers needs to be correlated together and treated as one application.

Changes:
- API now supports multiple deployment collectors per a single dashboard
- UI has ability to correlate applications together by ID (when enabled) thus allowing multiple deployment collector items to be used under the hood.
- Add API + UI configurable options ( #890 )

Everything else works the same. The component simply has more than one collector item attached (one for each server). The UI and API layer was updated to account for this.

In this example there is one app that exists (with the same application id) in sandbox, devdeploy, and deploy. Apps below it are in devdeploy and deploy. The app on top is only in devdeploy.

Sample database component:

[],"Is there a place where global system configurations live? The UI has the ability to configure themes but it doesn't seem this data is persisted.

I have a use case where I have a configuration that might effect multiple images (ui, api, and collectors). I need someplace common to store the configuration.
",181693198,890,Global configuration?,2016-10-07 15:07:20,2018-09-18 14:38:35,closed,6,MarkRx,"252545983 I always thought there should be a `/config` directory at the top-level of the project, which would contain all configuration for Hygieia.

There should be a `.dist` version for each config file (ex. `api.properties.dist`), which would be the ""distributable"" version of the configuration. You'd copy the dist version and remove the `.dist` to apply your custom configurations (ex. `api.properties`) - these would all be `.gitignore`ed.

I'd rather have all configuration in one file (`hygieia.properties`), but I'm not sure how everyone would feel about that.

Thoughts?

254901779 How would that work when using docker? I wouldn't want properties to be handled at compile time.

I think for now I'm going to look into creating a rest service on the api that returns a bunch of configuration options that the UI makes use of when deciding how to render the views. The properties would be set in the api's application.properties file. The config is still static (needs to be compiled before running) but I'm not sure it would make sense for those properties that I mentioned in my use case to be dynamically configurable.
 MarkRx
254930427 Yeah configuring docker containers is a little more complicated.. like you said, ideally configuration would be done at runtime, not compile time, so that you can have a generic image with specific configuration.

[],"This PR adds a dynamic product dashboard pipeline service that can be enabled with the feature.dynamicPipeline=enabled feature switch. This requires PR #815. More details in comment https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/804#issuecomment-247391585.

Basically data for commits, builds, deployments, and artifacts are associated dynamically using constructed composite keys. That correlated data is calculated on-demand. Doing so solves a number of synchronization issues that are pointed out below.

Data is correlated in the following ways: 
- Build -> Commit: Builds keep track of the SCM revision numbers as well as the repository and branch information (though builds with multiple repositories are not 100% accurate). Given a list of commits for the dashboard we can correlate builds to them using the scm revision number.
- EnvironmentComponent -> BinaryArtifact: Given a list of Environments we can gather DeploymentUnits and associate them to BinaryArtifacts by the component name and version number. In the future this information may be stored in metadata that is retrieved by the deployment collector. 
- BinaryArtifact -> Commit: An artifact will contain information about the HEAD svn revision number that was used to produce it. Given the scm revision number we can find it in our list of commits that are tracked for the dashboard and determine it along with all previous commits. For GIT this is done using a graph built from Commit.getScmParentRevisionNumbers(). For SVN we simply grab all revisions with a number less than ours.

This addresses the following issues
- #816 - Deploying old applications does not properly reflect in the product dashboard: only commits that come prior to the head commit for the version that was deployed are used
- #828 - Bug: Commits in the pipeline only show up in the last configured environment: since the EnvironmentComponent event listener doesn't play in to this this bug doesn't get hit
- #804 - Pipeline document not preemptively filled when created: pipeline is generated with each call
- #810 - NPE in CommitEventListener (bitbucket collector): partially fixed while I was in the code (no NPE)
- #869 - Bug: pipeline dashboard build commit time statistics off: fixed this while I was in the code
- #806 - Publishing artifacts requires build information to have already been collected: Fixed by PR #815

Note the following limitations / items not implemented at this time:
- Dynamic pipeline does not currently support SVN
- Date bounding is ignored as there is a current defect in the UI that shows itself here
- Only handles 1 component (though this is the same with the existing pipeline implementation)
- Jenkins branches are not 100% reliable - #857 - code currently does not filter on branch. We can get away with it for now due to commits already being filtered by branch. See comment in DynamicPipelineServiceImpl.filterBuilds for more info.
- Data doesn't display right away. This is an existing issue - #864. To work around open and close the options panel
- Jenkins commits sometimes get missed by builds. This is existing and occours with the event listener implementation as well. To work around it older commits that get skipped are added back using our best guess for a timestamp. This is a similar approach to what the BuildEventListener does
- Performance for very large datasets is not known. I don't think it will be a problem since it should be about on par with the amount of time to load team dashboards since it uses the same service calls
- Branch equality needs to be made smarter. Jenkins will use 'origin/master' whereas the user might only use 'master'

251776555 I've had a bunch of problems with the npm install / downloading of node_modules. I know one thing I had to do was have it hit our proxy directly instead of going through cntlm as cntlm would crash when under heavy load. Other team members run into issues and I just have them copy my entire node_modules folder from my vagrant vm that I managed to get working.

251792982 if you have a vagrant vm preconfigured , can you scrub your company data and publish it out , will save me time  as I was thinking on same lines for windows platform
 amitmawkin
251962157 @MarkRx Were you able to get the UI up and running on Linux VM? I faced same issues with node_modules as you mentioned and did the same workaround but the UI never came up for me on Linux platform. I have opened a issue too (https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/886) to know what should be the minimum OS requirements.

252237281 Unfortunately I don't think I can share the box since it is based off a company base image and I don't know where all the company specific items are saved in the box.

Yes I am able to run the UI in linux. I had to manually install a bunch of the programs needed. They only seemed to work with specific versions too. More details in #590

Here I am confused with adding collector thing.
Like I have to add Git and Jira
What I have done 
Step 1 : added application.properties in github collector and mvn install
Step 2 : Same thing I have done with JIRA

Now I have two jars which I have to add or bind with api so that these jar automatically starts with api start-up
for api startup i am using : java -jar api.jar --spring.config.name=api -Dserver.contextPath=/api --spring.config.location=application.properties

How to bind these jar into api or any solutions instead of firing each of these collector jar individually anuragmishra-sn

 satishc1
255064045 Based on one of the suggestion referenced the UI readme file section in the  Encryption for private repos

Following the below step have generated a secret key and updated the respective properties file. Look like this also did not help..
1. From module core generate a secret key.
   
   ``` bash
   java -jar <path-to-jar>/core-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
   ```
2. Add this generated key to api.properties
   
   ``` properties
   ### api.properties
   key=<your-generated-key>
   ```
3. Add the same key to your repo settings file.
   This is needed for the target collector to decrypt your saved repo password.
   For example, if your repo is github add the following.
   
   ``` properties
   ### github.properties
   github.key=<your-generated-key>

 tabladrum
250781646 @tabladrum a couple of points after reviewing the code for your consideration:
1. A minor point I think the sql file should be .sql not .js as .js is normally javascript.
2. I haven't had time to run a test, but reviewing the files db/db-setup.js & db/db-setup.sh I think we will get errors the second time it runs if you re-create everything as the Database will already exist.  I think there needs to be an if not exists user around the create commands. I think you need to do something like this: 

> mongo --port 27037 --quiet -u superuser -p pwd 
>     --eval ""db.system.users.find({user:'db'}).count()"" admin

If it returns zero then the id does not exist and you should exec the id creation. (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12856420/mongodb-command-line-to-show-if-a-user-exists-for-puppet-unless-clause)

So the test is written to verify that save is called with the instance c one time.
`verify(baseCollectorRepository, times(1)).save(c);`

Save is called twice each with different instances. What is probably desired is checking that save is called twice using Mockito.any(Collector.class).

My failure is due to adding hashcode and equals to the BaseModel that is based on the ObjectId. When running junits the ObjectId is null so Collectors have the same hashcode and are equal. As a result it appears that save (c) is called twice since each invocation equality check works out.

Hence when the collector first runs and picks up a lot of builds these builds will have nearly identical timestamps.

The code should instead reference build.getStartTime() (or build.getEndTime()) to more accurately represent when the commit entered that stage of the pipeline.

Haven't tried this - but my guess is, both the collectors will try to collect. Both may be successful too (depending upon the auth).  But the commits will not be duplicated.

Can anybody tell me what may be the issue here? The communication with Mongo is working fine and I believe I configured correctly the properties file. Will appreciate any help.

253637113 @oshingc jira version? I have had problems with 7.1.9. In the past it could pull 200 issues in ~1 second. Now it takes 30 seconds. I had to decrease the page size to 25 to get it to work without timing out.

249227773 The collector is having issues communicating with jira. The connection is timing out. Try hitting the rest api manually to see if issues come back in a timely manner. You can also try decreasing the page size.
 MarkRx
249235399 Alredy tried what you are suggesting. Tried with curl from same place where I'm running the collector and its working file, I'm getting the response. Also tried decreasing the page size. Don't know what else to try.

249239663 Turn up debugging by putting these in your properties file:

``` properties
logging.level.com.atlassian.jira=INFO
logging.level.com.capitalone.dashboard=DEBUG
logging.level.com.capitalone.dashboard.collector=DEBUG
```

those options are not available through docker-compose so you have to modify the command that is run and point it to a mounted properties file.

Is there more to the stack trace? What line is failing on in the hygieia code?
 MarkRx
249243574 Still not running anything with docker.  I have Mongo Up, the API layer UP and connected to the DB, the UI is also showing me that is connected to the API successfully. Only the collector seems to be giving me problems, it is reaching the DB, cause i see it on the log file but for some reason is not getting anything from Jira and I'm getting that Timeout that I showed you.
I added the lines you gave me and here is the complete stack trace:

249280155 Does curl work from within the running docker container? You can attach a bash shell to the container and run curl.

Is your user account locked that it is trying to use? Is jira behind a proxy?

The code is timing out attempting to get all of the projects on the jira server.

249882063 You might have the same problem as #698

If you're running Hygieia from within a VM, the API will be listening at `http://localhost:8080` in your VM - in order to access it from the host, you should be able to use `http://10.0.2.2:8080`.

If you're not using a VM, you should be able to reach the API at `http://localhost:8080`. The UI should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

256927515 I agree with @amitmawkin. I've conversed a lot with @pxk5958 and we came to the same conclusion. The ""multi-repository"" functionality for the git plugin is broken and unreliable.

 tabladrum
248899364 There are few ways this might fail. One such can be this situation:
1. Setup Jenkins job with two git repo (not using MultiSCM plugin). Commit to both and you will notice that there are two back to back Jenkins builds - for each repo changes. See if your code can match the right branch.
2. If there are multiple commits in a single build, the branch refers to the top level commit. In a build with changes to multiple git repos (using Multi SCM plugin), there is no simple way to match the branch - unless we assume certain formatting to be true: origin refers to repo[0], origin1 refers to repo[1] etc.
 tabladrum
248918607 @pxk5958 could you take a look?
 MarkRx
249019343 @tabladrum Thanks. I am looking into the various cases.
 pxk5958
251985289 What we are going to do is given the branch information and the originX number we can determine the remoteUrl by pulling the job config that was used for the build and correlating the X to the X'th repo. 

It turns out that the ""remoteUrls"" list is buggy to begin with so this should be more reliable. I found a case where I specified multiple repositories but it ended up building one of them and claiming it built the other one.
 MarkRx
253910170 There are 2 cases to consider here.
1. Multiple repositories configured through Jenkins MultiSCM plugin. 
   In this case, each remoteUrl is in a separate action in the json response, so we just have to iterate over the actions and find the remoteUrl and corresponding branch in the lastBuiltRevision of each action. 
2. Multiple repositories configured through the 'Add repository' button on the Jenkins Git plugin.
   In this case, the remoteUrls are together in the same action and are not necessarily in the correct order to associate the remote origin, origin1, origin2,...,origin[n] with the corresponding url. There are 2 ways to go about solving this:
   (a) Parse the jenkins job config.xml and find out the remoteUrls in order. There are 2 drawbacks to this approach. If the config.xml file was changed in the time between when a job is triggered and before the queued job finally executes, we cannot get the right config.xml since we don't have the information as to when exactly the job was triggered (as opposed to when it was executed which is available in the json). The other drawback is that if the repository url is parameterized in the config, we won't have the correct url as well.
   (b) Jenkins Git plugin currently stores the remoteUrls in a HashSet which is why they are unordered. I modified it to a LinkedHashSet so that we can get them ordered and hence associate with the correct branch. I have raised an issue (https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38800) and have submitted a pull request with this change (https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/pull/441) but the maintainer doesn't see so far why we would need to configure multiple repositories.
   Also, like @MarkRx mentioned, sometimes the build information is wrong when multiple repositories are configured in the Git plugin, but it happens only if we change the job configuration by adding more repositories after at least 1 build has already been done. In other words, results are consistent as long as we never add more repositories after a job has been created and executed at least once.

Considering these, I think we should drop support for multiple repositories in Git plugin since it seems buggy but should support adding branch information for single repositories and MultiSCM plugin. What do you think? @tabladrum

[],"Hi, 

I am facing issue with JIRA status not showing up in Hygieia dashboard. Look like it is something to do with the application.properties.

In Hygieia only the JIRA Project Name appear when you select that no details will be shown.

Any solution or suggestion would be of great help.

249586861 The documentation in the docker yml file indicates that JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE_ID should be set to the ID of the User Story or Epic IssueType. However, in StoryDataClientImpl.java at line 194 it reads that value into a String issueTypeName, then compares each jira's issue type name against that ID. It never processes feature/sprint/assignee data in the loop. I found this in 2.0.2, but appears to be the same in master.
Changing line 210 to compare against issueType.getId() fixes the problem and jira data appears in the widget.

The `-d` flag should run the container in daemon mode, so the terminal should give you back your shell session.

On the properties file for the jenkins build collector, we don't use any API keys. What are other ways of authentication? Can it collect using username/password combination?
# Jenkins server (required) - Can provide multiple

jenkins.servers[0]=http://jenkins.company.com
# If using username/token for api authentication
# (required for Cloudbees Jenkins Ops Center) see sample

jenkins.servers[1]=http://username:token@jenkins.company.com

Q: Based on the details that we have in DB for SVN, can we configure anything in Hygieia to send mails for  SVN details as report.
Or please let me know if we have any script available separately that we use to get the details and send the report.

Greetings!

I apologize for getting super late with my progress, since I got stuck with some other issues. 
So here I am. After including both the commands/instructions as mentioned below:
1) replace ""./properties-builder.sh"" by ""sh properties-builder.sh"".
2) RUN sed -i -e 's/\r$//' ./properties-builder.sh

I am not getting the 'Permission Denied' issue again :+1: . and while running the command:
docker run -p 8080:8080 --link mongodbi:mongo -i hygieia-api:latest 
The result is being displayed below.

[],"Hello,
I am trying to do a POC to for Jenkins cucumber collector, the CollectorTask is not able to find the cucumber.json

I found in the log the program expects cucumber.json under http://jenkins.company.com/Project1/job/SubProject 
Does the project search cucumber.json is in subfolders in my case the path is something like this  
http://jenkins.company.com/Project1/job/SubProject/ lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/proj/target/test_results/cucumber.json

(if you run via the docker container all of this is automatic).

I was referring to this file: 
Hygieia/test-servers/jenkins/jobs/Hygieia_Example_Job/config.xml

it sets-up a jenkins job that the collector should find, this will give you a starting point.

248096368 from the root of the project can you run ‘mvn clean install’

if this completes successfully run
‘docker-compose up -d’

248199498 This might not solve your problem, but it's worth a shot 😃 

You should be able to run any module like this, too:

``` bash
mvn spring-boot:run \
  -pl <project> \
  -Dspring.config.location=<path>
# example:
mvn spring-boot:run \
  -pl collectors/build/jenkins-cucumber \
  -Dspring.config.location=config/jenkins-cucumber.properties
```

(I should probably document this somewhere haha)

I'm not really familiar with the Jenkins Cucumber collector, but if you need to pass JVM args in, you can do that with the usual `-D...` prefixed args.

248329425 @jimzucker  I cannot do docker with the existing setup, So I am trying the other way. For the jenkins-cucumber collector tried various paths but it could not get the cucumber.json available in the path. I'm still trying to find out, I will update more what I find. 
@mrpudn  yes, I am able to run the module this way.
Thank you! 
 narendraes
247456487 Take a look at the job.xml with the test jenkins docker folder this will answer your questions

Update: This is the example I am referring to: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/test-servers/jenkins/jobs/Hygieia_Example_Job/config.xml

247896594 Thanks @jimzucker, did you mean the docker shell(jenkins-cucumber-test-properties-builder.sh), I found below, I hope this works if copied into application.properties . Yet to try !! 

#pattern to find cucubmer reports
jenkins-cucumber.cucumberJsonRegex=${JENKINS_CUCUMBER_JSON_FILENAME:-cucumber.json}

Thx,
Naren !

248199498 This might not solve your problem, but it's worth a shot 😃 

You should be able to run any module like this, too:

``` bash
mvn spring-boot:run \
  -pl <project> \
  -Dspring.config.location=<path>
# example:
mvn spring-boot:run \
  -pl collectors/build/jenkins-cucumber \
  -Dspring.config.location=config/jenkins-cucumber.properties
```

(I should probably document this somewhere haha)

I'm not really familiar with the Jenkins Cucumber collector, but if you need to pass JVM args in, you can do that with the usual `-D...` prefixed args.
 mrpudn
248329425 @jimzucker  I cannot do docker with the existing setup, So I am trying the other way. For the jenkins-cucumber collector tried various paths but it could not get the cucumber.json available in the path. I'm still trying to find out, I will update more what I find. 
@mrpudn  yes, I am able to run the module this way.
Thank you!

This is due to the EventComponentEventListener being triggered on any environment_component that is saved. The XLD collector is resaving environment_components even if they have not changed. Not sure if the UDeploy collector is doing this too. As a result commits are being added to every environment in a pipeline which causes hygieia to interpret them as always being promoted to the last environment.

Code:

```
                if (!compList.isEmpty()) {
                    List<EnvironmentComponent> existingComponents = envComponentRepository

[],"Duplicate collector_items can be created which results in strange behavior. Below is an example for SCM collector_items but I suspect this may happen in other places.

Steps to reproduce
1. Create a dashboard and set it up the ""Code Repo"" widget to use a repository that has not been used.
2. Wait for a scm collector to run
3. Refresh the page. Open the widget and save it.

There will now be 2 collector_items that correspond to the same repo + branch + scm type combination.

This is because once the scm collector runs the collector might have additional options tacked on. For example, the BitbucketCollector adds the ""lastUpdate"" and ""lastCommit"" options. Hence findByCollectorAndOptions does not find the existing collector_item since the incoming item.getOptions() do not contain this information.
CollectorServiceImpl.java:

```
    public CollectorItem createCollectorItem(CollectorItem item) {
        CollectorItem existing = collectorItemRepository.findByCollectorAndOptions(
                item.getCollectorId(), item.getOptions());
        if (existing != null) {
            item.setId(existing.getId());
        }
        return collectorItemRepository.save(item);
    }
```

I think findByCollectorAndOptions needs to be changed to allow items to show up if they have additional properties that do not exist in the incoming map. Will have to check mongo documentation if this can be done.

{'options.scm':1,
'options.branch':1,
'options.url':1}

I think findByCollectorAndOptions would have to be manually implemented to search for the properties in the map. 
 MarkRx

[],"A concept of ""component"" is used throughout Hygieia, especially in the context of deployments. For example, environment_component collection associates environment data to ""components"". Component.java has this:

> - has a different source repo, build job, deploy job, etc.

Suppose I have an application with two parts that come from two wars: myapp-api.war and myapp-ui.war. These are deployed together. For the sake of argument suppose they are built separately and come from separate repositories.
1. **Components live at the artifact level**. They are what comes out of builds. Both myapp-api.war and myapp-ui.war are components. They happen to be deployed together.
2. **Components live at the deployment level**. They consist of a collection of artifacts. In this example my component is a deployment package that consists of myapp-api.war and myapp-ui.war. They are always deployed together.

I've been assuming that number 2 is the definition that is being used - namely tracking deployment packages as opposed to individual artifacts. However, it doesn't appear that Hygieia is setup to handle this situation the way I devised it. In particular, the product dashboard can only watch 1 artifact from 1 build that comes from 1 repository. The scenario I setup has 1 component : 2 builds : 2 repositories.

247000205 Here is a potential solution:
1. Artifacts need to store information about the scmRevisionNumber, scmUrl, and scmBranch that was used to create them. For a MVP we should assume an artifact comes from one repository.
2. Commits need to store information to allow a graph to be built in memory. A commit can store its parent commits (more than one for merges). A graph can be built in memory based on the HEAD information from the artifact. For scm we might be able to assume all scm revision numbers less than the one stored on the artifact are ancestors.
3. With the information from 1 and 2 determine the commits for the artifact being deployed in the environment in EnvironmentComponentEventListener. We would have to correlate the component version with the artifact version for now until a more flexible association mechanism can be devised.

```
- Modified /artifacts rest API endpoint slightly to accept a map of metadata
- Code that makes use of artifacts was updated to grab build information as needed by correlating jobUrl, instanceUrl, and buildNumber
- Jenkins plugin updated to work with api changes

This change allows for an independent artifact collector to be created. It also allows artifacts data to be inserted into the database before build data has been collected. Example curl to perform:

```
curl -X POST http://myapiendpoint:8080/api/artifact -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data \
""{ \""artifactName\"": \""Helloworld\"", \""canonicalName\"": \""Helloworld\"", \""artifactGroup\"": \""mygroup\"", \""artifactVersion\"": \""$projectVersion\"", \""timestamp\"": $(date +%s%3N), \""metadata\"": { \""buildUrl\"": \""$BUILD_URL\"", \""buildNumber\"" : $BUILD_NUMBER, \""jobName\"": \""$JOB_NAME\"", \""jobUrl\"": \""$JOB_URL\"", \""instanceUrl\"": \""$JENKINS_URL\"" } }""
```

"
[],"When you do a `mvn clean install`, there are TONS of info-level and debug-level messages. Most of the time, you're really only ever looking for warn-level and error-level messages. This makes it hard to tell if anything out of the ordinary happened during a build (and it's a heck of a lot of text to try and parse through).

Even running maven in quiet-mode (i.e. `mvn clean install -q`) doesn't work completely - the source of the problem seems to stem from each application's logging configuration. Ideally, you'd give maven a command-line arg to increase the verbosity of a build (maybe only for Travis builds and if you're actually interested in info/error-level messages for something). By default, the amount of messages displayed during a build would be kept to an absolute minimum.

Thoughts?

I think I've gotten this working on a previous project just by changing configurations for logback, etc., so I could give it a shot if you guys think it's a good idea.

where buildInfo is a duplicate of what would exist in the build collection. At present buildInfo is populated by BinaryArtifactService by using a String representing an ObjectID that is passed in to the /artifact rest API endpoint.

This model requires a build to already exist in the database by the time artifact data is populated. It is also redundant. The result of this coupling prevents an artifact collector from being feasible as there wouldn't be a reasonable way to coordinate it with an independent build collector.

I propose that the BinaryArtifact document be changed to look something like this:

```
{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""57d2c61646e0fb000d3ef42d""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.BinaryArtifact"",
    ""timestamp"" : NumberLong(0),
    ""artifactName"" : ""Helloworld"",
    ""canonicalName"" : ""Helloworld"",
    ""artifactGroupId"" : ""mygroup"",
    ""artifactVersion"" : ""myversion"",
    ""buildData"" : {
        ""buildNumber"" : 140
        ""buildUrl"" : ""mybuildurl/job/etc""
   }
}
```

Code that needs to relate artifacts to builds can still do so by using buildUrl + buildNumber as a composite key to search for a unique build in the builds collection. This loosens the coupling allowing for artifact information and build information to be pulled independently of eachother. As a result an artifact collector could be created in the future (note that the artifacts would have to have metadata to associate them to builds such as artifactory properties).

Initially my vagrant vm worked with 2 but it wasn't enough and it caused docker containers to crash. A decent cpu would be necessary as you will have a lot of containers running.
