Hi 
Today i have cloned latest code from github repo(### https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia). Before docker compose command, i just done one change in override file(### docker-compose-override.hygieia.yml

) i.e. added one collector(jenkins) environment details like below.
###   jenkins-build-collector:
      environment:
        - JENKINS_CRON= 0 * * * * *
        - JENKINS_MASTER= http://awszzzz.com:8080
        - JENKINS_USERNAME= admin
        - JENKINS_API_KEY=zzzz
and then ran a docker-compose build command(docker-compose up -d) to install,
but iam endup with below error. Can anyone please help on this.
Attached my docker yaml files above for reference. Thanks

[],"Hi Team,
i am trying to create a docker image and deploy in cloud as a POC , hence i am looking for a way to test the dashboard locally once i deploy the docker image.
we have this command to test locally --> gulp serve --local true
but for docker we will be executing the command --> docker run -t -p 8088:80 --link hygieia-api -i hygieia-ui:latest

can anyone please let me know how to use test data for UI when API/UI/DB are containerized.

Regards,
vishal ",426809963,2804,how to test UI locally for docker,2019-03-29 04:20:57,2019-06-24 16:49:44,open,16,vishalbisa,"504892573 @vishalbisa Are you using separate mongo service in kubernetes and created dashboarddb in it.
Can you please share some steps which you followed to perform the deployment of hygieia on kubernetes as we are facing issues while deploying on kubernetes. rabindersethi
504970256 Yes I am using separate mongo service and post that I have done a ssh inside the container and created the dashboarddb.
Another method is you need to build and create a docker image from the source code which has the script which creates the dashboard db.

You can choose any of these methods vishalbisa

As you have mentioned above to use **docker run -t -p 8088:80 --link hygieia-api -i hygieia-ui:latest** to have UI running. 
Per your pervious comment, we have done the same, have separate service for mongo but we still have DB connectivity issue. We took one collector to start with, but none of API, UI and Jenkins aren't working. 

We have created YAMLs to create deployment and service in kubernetes. Could you please share the steps you followed or how you have done the deployment in Kubernetes.  ekta-thakur
505033694 As I said it would be better if we have a screen share session , but I have deployed it manually and not worked on YAMLs to create deployment vishalbisa
505090600 To add above point after deployment of mongo.. expose the service and take the IP address and port no and put it in application.properties file for API n COLLECTOR.
It should work then  vishalbisa

497755203 @vishalbisa I am not familiar with loading test data to hygieia. I will try read up but will likely be sometime before I can respond back about it. Sbrenthughes
497799363 Thanks @Sbrenthughes  apologies for adding another issue, i am trying to use jenkins collector with open source jenkins ( https://ci.jenkins.io ), i am getting the error as MONGO_PORT is not defined attached below screenshot, also attached my properties-buildler.sh file.
i am not sure from where these parameters are fetching as i dont see those in my properties file.

I updated collectors>build>jenkins>docker>properties-builder.sh as below and MONGO_PORT error was resolved;

As I am also working on similar POC to deploy Hygieia on kubernetes cluster. were you able to bring UI up?

 I am getting error for UI container:

477228136 Is this a local deployment? 
If this is local can you comment out `dbreplicaset=false`
and `dbhostport=localhost:27017,127.0.0.1:27017`

In this context, I am opening this issue in a hope that we can solidify OSS contribution process for Hygieia project. 
I have explored some other popular opensource project and how they manage OSS contributions. Here I will take the example of Spring Framework and Apple’s Swift project and highlight their OSS contribution process.

- **Spring Framework**: Spring project enforces contributors to sign [Contributor’s License Agreement](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) Please see [Pivotal CLA](https://cla.pivotal.io/about) for more details on why this is needed.

- **Swift**: Contributing guide to swift opensource project can be found in [Swift Contribution Guide]( https://swift.org/contributing/#contributing-code)
Swift project maintainers clearly mention list of copyright headers in the [CONTRIBUTORS.txt](https://swift.org/CONTRIBUTORS.txt) file. This file include all the contributors. Please see their license details [Swift License](https://swift.org/community/#license)

These projects protect copyright and make contributors copyright easily traceable.
Looking forward to collaborating and I am happy to provide additional details on this topic(if required).

I am getting 401 Unauthorized when trying to configure SCM widget and collector for Hygieia. Do i have to add the generated key to gitlab ? where in gitlab should i update

Any help is appreciated . Thanks in Advance

I have passed the project ID as well but still won't fetch info. and below are details of application.properties , Output and widget configuration

**Application.properties**

gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15
gitlab.key=0CaGVCAHikVRH48WKZHpfD7NAQ4ET6T

**To generate API key followed the below steps**

1. create an admin user - useername - ""admin"" , password -""you can chose any password""
2. go to admin settings -> Generate Api token -> create new key by setting name  and expiration date.

**Repo Widget have updated the below info:**

1) delete widget and reconfigure with out api token 
2) remove below props 
`gitlab.apiToken=iN1Lb+dNRqagRq4HUeMfDRnmrDo0j3Ac4kvgHlsLnUx
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15
gitlab.key=0CaGVCAHikVRH48WKZHpfD7NAQ4ET6T`

if it is private repo, follow these steps 
1) deleted configured widget
2) remove below props 
`gitlab.apiToken=iN1Lb+dNRqagRq4HUeMfDRnmrDo0j3Ac4kvgHlsLnUx
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15

3) generate personal access token in gitlab -> developer settings -> genereate token 
4) use generated token in prop file as 
gitlab.apiToken= <generated from gitlab
`
5) reconfigure repo widget without apiToken, process will take it from prop file.  If you configure on widget, that will take precedence over prop file. 
6) run collector

Collector for security issues from Coverity for the security tab of the quality widget. The security tab is configured with a Coverity Stream and its corresponding Coverity Project.

And another concern: In the screen shot above you can see the rows for each severity level, but they are not clickable, i.e. to see more details. However, The OPENSOURCE tab has a pop-up for details and so does the TEST tab. But STATIC ANALYSIS does not have a details pop-up, just a link.

Is there a reason the security widget and STATIC ANALYSIS do not have the details page like the other two? 
There is a PR in progress for a Fortify collector which is in the same situation. fidelcoria-aa
484630197 @fidelcoria-aa We are working on separating the projects to seperate repos, Can you move this new collector to `https://github.com/Hygieia` ? Please let me know if you have any issues w.r.t. this. rvema
484639926 @rvema Understood. but have 2 questions.
1. will each collector have its own repo? or will there be a repo for each category of collectors? like build category has jenkins, bamboo etc collectors.
2. I do not have permission to create a repo in Hygieia Org. Will you add me as a collaborator to the org?  fidelcoria-aa
489209760 Hey! I see there was a repo created for coverity collector! I will raise the pull request as is to that repo. I guess we will repeat the review comments from here in the new repo. fidelcoria-aa
489211299 Raising the pull request to the new repo means I have to fork the new repo and then make a branch for coverity changes and **then** create PR.... I don't have enough time for this now. I will come back in a couple weeks. fidelcoria-aa
469447413 I overlooked my comment in the CoverityProject.java file while preparing the PR. Looking back I think the setup works (ie uniquely identifying a `Coverity Collector-Item` as a Coverity Project _and_ Coverity Stream together. 

Would you agree with renaming this class to CoverityProjectStream.java?  fidelcoria-aa

We did remove bower config from UI https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/pull/2732, so it is just npm and gulp.  Refer https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/7f4e3597ff65cd015db576125c82d6fbdbbafe3e/pages/hygieia/UI/ui.md for installation steps. 
Recommended to upgrade node version to latest  nireeshT
467989690 If you are stilling having issues, try deleting 'node_modules', 'dist', and 'bower_components' from your UI folder manually. Then try rebuilding. This should force your project to use the latest set of dependencies.

Also make sure you have the latest version of the core downloaded and built (https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core ). 

Let us know if you are still having problems. kheinz04

Please note, as per above comments mentioned by @nireeshT , I performed git pull before actually building the project and even removed bower.json files from the local repo. sameer-shukur
469421622 @shreyamNewt  @sameer-shukur  if you have node_modules and bower_components under UI, delete them and 
1) run npm install 
2) gulp serve

467903395 Did you download the latest version and build? Were there any build errors?

 kheinz04
467938990 @shreyamNewt  get latest code and do clean install. We did remove bower config from UI https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/pull/2732, so it is just npm and gulp.  Refer https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/7f4e3597ff65cd015db576125c82d6fbdbbafe3e/pages/hygieia/UI/ui.md for installation steps. 
Recommended to upgrade node version to latest  nireeshT
467989690 If you are stilling having issues, try deleting 'node_modules', 'dist', and 'bower_components' from your UI folder manually. Then try rebuilding. This should force your project to use the latest set of dependencies.

Also make sure you have the latest version of the core downloaded and built (https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core ). 

Let us know if you are still having problems. kheinz04

1)  I am unable to retrieve the Author of a merge request or Issue. Can you confirm this? 
2) Number should be the number of the merge request and not the id. In my case it should be 2. (Same for issues)

The  ""commits on the pr object"" is **gitrequests**' **commitStatuses**?

Just now seeing that you had a question. The commits would go in the `commits` array. Similar to the below:
```
""commits"" : [ 
        {
            ""_id"" : null,
            ""timestamp"" : NumberLong(0),
            ""firstEverCommit"" : false,
            ""scmRevisionNumber"" : """",
            ""scmCommitLog"" : """",
            ""scmAuthor"" : ""<AutherName>"",
            ""scmAuthorLogin"" : """",
            ""scmAuthorLDAPDN"" : """",
            ""scmCommitTimestamp"" : NumberLong(1547066676000),
            ""numberOfChanges"" : NumberLong(0)
        }
    ]

468003966 We recently updated the project to remove bower so there may be some dependency issues. Try deleting 'node_modules', 'dist', and 'bower_components' from your UI folder manually, then try rebuilding. This should force your project to use the latest set of dependencies. You can also make sure npm is up to date by running 'npm update'.

Also make sure you have the latest version of the core downloaded and built ( https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core ).
We recommend having the latest version of node as well.

These were the resolutions to the main issues our team was having after the update. Let us know if you are still having problems after trying these out. kheinz04

468482357 It won’t work passing it from the UI if you don’t have the encryption setup. Which you don’t.

You’ll likely need to generate a personal access token to use.  Sbrenthughes

Try deleting 'node_modules', 'dist', and 'bower_components' from your UI folder manually, then try rebuilding. This should force your project to use the latest set of dependencies. You can also make sure npm is up to date by running 'npm update'.

Also make sure you have the latest version of the core downloaded and built (https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core ).
We recommend having the latest version of node as well.

These were the resolutions to the main issues our team was having after the update. Let us know if you are still having problems after trying these out. kheinz04

Updated directive to more efficiently add and search for ""noDataMsg"" elements.

Updated formatting for test tab to display data better
- add ""No data found"" under header in addition to showing if no test fields are populated
- Removed some of the left padding to match alignment
- Updated scroll to only appear if there are enough items to make scroll necessary

[],"So, I have been asked to evaluate Hygieia for use with our stack and right away I suspect the Bitbucket cloud connector only supports API v1. I say this based on documentation that refers to the `v1/api`
As well as looking at [The actual code](https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/search?q=DefaultBitbucketCloudClient&unscoped_q=DefaultBitbucketCloudClient)

The whole reason this is an issue is because [bitbucket is discontinuing the 1.0 endpoint in April](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-v1-apis/) and it's significantly different than 2.0 - I know this because I just got done with a lot of integration straddling between them

Also, not directly related but important: BB is deprecating API tokens in favor of OAUTH

https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/

**My issue:** Am I correct in my assumptions about V2 support for BB?",413555534,2746,BB Connector support for BB API 2.0,2019-02-22 19:56:55,2019-06-05 17:59:53,open,2,chb0github,"498640247 @shishirchaturvedi any thoughts here? rvema
498912542 @chb0github I think you are right. This is the code which fetches commits,
https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/40b4242e2740b3b0bbc4aba4aaabb087e99dcbff/collectors/scm/bitbucket/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/DefaultBitbucketCloudClient.java#L98
I didn't find `/repositories/` path in the rest API URL. This doesn't match with [BB Rest API v2](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Busername%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commits)
In Hygieia SCM collector, the main mechanism for authenticating REST API is HTTP header authentication. 
I am not using Bitbucket Cloud so I can't test its integration in Hygieia. 
As you are using Bitbucket Cloud so you can take current implementation for Bitbucket Cloud in Hygieia as starting point and can enhance it to support V2 and [Oauth2](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html).

485911811 @varshinichowdary27 and @sundeepk1 are you still having an issue with the above? rvema
486508285 I am not sure as what caused the error, Below were the steps that I took to have a successful build.

1. Deleted the directory
2. removed the installed java version
3. installed openjdk-8-jdk and openjdk-8-jre 
4. cloned the repo again
5. ran the mvn build commands

this time it was successful .   sundeepk1

466370415 Can you ensure you have the latest hygieia-core and hygieia projects? rvema

Also can you please specify the project structure of entire hygieia project. varshinichowdary27
466382119 can you explain - `installed the latest version`? I am assuming you are cloning the respos from `https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia.git` and `https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core.git` rvema
466382821 yes, i am cloning from github varshinichowdary27

468662201 It’s trying to collect from today. You need to again delete the team, scope and feature collections. Update the collector’s timestamp fields to 0 for the jira collector in the `collectors` collection.  Sbrenthughes

466394512 Can you delete the team, scope and feature collection? Once that is done can you verify that the project/board combo on the UI matches what is in Jira? Finally rerun the collector 

Also, did you build the latest UI as well? Sbrenthughes

**in properties-builder.sh, there is a mistake having it generate ""application.properties"" when test_script is defined or /config/hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties** 

collector should have followed standard properties file ""application.properties"" rather than jumping between to avoid docker-compose issues

**resolved by placing PROP_FILE /hygieia/config/application.properties in docker-compose.override.yml file when using docker-compose** mirageglobe

463635972 For the branch you are collecting, are there PRs within the last 14days ?

Do you see any errors in the collector logs? Sbrenthughes
463668463 @Sbrenthughes yes,there are PRs within the last 14days.And there is no error in the container's log lyndomiao
463670199 Are the PRs for the branch you have configured in the UI? Sbrenthughes
463868903 @Sbrenthughes yes,I have configured in the UI,and  the commits data shown in widget is right lyndomiao
463955936 @lyndomiao according to the source code, the gitlab scm collector get the commits data only, no pulls and issues data.

464051625 @zhenweiding thanks for looking into this. I should not have assumed that logic was present. Can either of you implement it and make a PR back ? Sbrenthughes
464410959 @zhenweiding thank u for help!I did not read the Hygieia source code,and I thought Hygieia collector had implemented all the functions.I can implement the function of 'issues count' of Gitlab SCM Collector by Gitlab API '/projects/:id/issues',but I can not find the API to get 'pulls count'.Do u know how to resolve it? lyndomiao
465091103 Gitlab collector doesnt collect previous data even though I added 
**gitlab.commitThresholdDays=45**

Gitlab URI: http://Gitlab-xxxx:80/api/v4/projects/xxxxxxxxxx/repository/commits/?ref_name=master&since=2019-02-19T11:07:30.032Z&per_page=100

Is there any other property file which also needs to be updated? rikameajay1
465136391 @rikameajay1 I am not sure your issue is related here. Can you open a new issue? Sbrenthughes

@lyndomiao There is no 'pull' or 'PR' in GitLab, i think the 'merge requests(MR)' in GitLab is similar to 'pulls(PR)' in GitHub. 
Here is the Gitlab's API:
GET /projects/:id/merge_requests
and the link:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/merge_requests.html

thanks poojithkumar
467821556 @poojithkumar github.username and github.password isn't required.
and change github.host to https://github.com/ and if the repo is public personalaccesstoken is also not needed, but keeping it is no harm.

I tried pulling your github repo and is worked rikameajay1
467865940 And I think host name is also not a problem ... it's not going to deal this
error

467869977 What command are you using to run this? And your host shouldn’t be the url to your repo.  Sbrenthughes
467879154 With correct jar version.and path

java -jar github-collector.jar --spring.config.name=github
--spring.config.location=[path to application.properties file]

467881243 From the ui repo widget did you try to add a token? If so clear it and try again. 

Also, please continue this thread in the issue you opened related to Github. Sbrenthughes
467918522 Yup.. I added that. In ui and github properties file .. i remember , first
I tried without key since I get error I added that.
 Thank you for the response. I will try that also.

465166370 i'd recommend having a docker(builder - based on maven/jdk8) which builds the whole project. and then running compose on the project. it helps by using the default properties builder scripts. Make sure your override.yml permissions file is well defined. mirageglobe
465196009 thanks,
is there any document regarding collectors and api building?

[],"**Hello Team,**
I am trying to publish my test data onto the dashboard.Had Installed Cucumber Reports plugin in Jenkins and have my pipeline script for this.Though my jenkins build is successful, there is some 500 Internal Error appearing while publishing the data.From Api logs, noticed an error like invalid hexadecimal representation of an objectid.

Please find the below details for more information:
Attached the script,Job's console and API logs.
Any Help would be highly appreciated.Thanks!!

# API token generated for basic authentication to secure APIs.
key=***********************

github collector application property contains     
# This is the key generated using the Encryption class in core
    github.key=<your-generated-key>

Is this both are same if so do i need to give the key generated through admin ui in the both the fields or the key generated through core jar as mentioned in http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/collectors.html#encryption-for-private-repos in both the fields siva-veeraraj
462940684 @Sbrenthughes 

Hi,

I gave the same key generated through UI in both the property file and it worked. Before  giving the key i have configured that repo in the widget so it showed an error like below.
![repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47429392/52668730-f08c0580-2ed9-11e9-9df6-9da01d6633fc.png)

after giving the key it started pulling the data but still that 404 error is showing in the widget.  siva-veeraraj
462960952 @Sbrenthughes ... one last question does rally collector collect the feature id details ? siva-veeraraj
463297793 I am not sure what the feature id is in Rally. I can only help with general collector setup issues in this instance.  Sbrenthughes
480403790 @siva-veeraraj - I am also facing the same issue where rally server information is not updated in mongo database, I tried dropping database, deleting .spring file and all the suggestion. Is there any specific things you performed? nitingoyal8
462521036 please find the output of db.collectors.find(). I think properties mentioned in the property file are not updated in the DB.

{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5c61a8e4d79c5f0b60dc1597""), ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.RallyCollector"", ""rallyServers"" : [ ], ""name"" : ""Rally"", ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"", ""enabled"" : true, ""online"" : true, ""errors"" : [ ], ""uniqueFields"" : {  }, ""allFields"" : {  }, ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(""1549923900150""), ""searchFields"" : [ ""description"" ] }

This is how am running the application:

java -jar rally-collector-3.0.1.jar --spring.config.name=rally --spring.config.location=C:\*******\Hygieia-master\Hygieia-master\collectors\feature\rally\application.properties siva-veeraraj
462728008 I guess this issue is similar to #2724. buradeshruti
462762486 @buradeshruti ... it didnt work.. actually my problem is something the rally configuration details are not getting stored in collector collection in mongodb.

{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5c61a8e4d79c5f0b60dc1597""), ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.RallyCollector"", **""rallyServers"" : [ ], ""n**ame"" : ""Rally"", ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"", ""enabled"" : true, ""online"" : true, ""errors"" : [ ], ""uniqueFields"" : { }, ""allFields"" : { }, ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(""1549923900150""), ""searchFields"" : [ ""description"" ] } siva-veeraraj
462762664 if the properties are stored in the DB then it will work i guess.  siva-veeraraj
462769803 @tabladrum . Hi can you please help me in this issue siva-veeraraj
462863772 @matthewbeasley 

Hi Can you please help me on this. I dont see any data fetched from rally. I think problem with loading the application properties.  siva-veeraraj
462876644 @Sbrenthughes
Hi,

I have all the details  mentioned above siva-veeraraj
462887484 Actually, I see where the collector didn't insert the server URL. Can you try deleting that row and rerunning the collector? Sbrenthughes
462893669 @Sbrenthughes .. Thank you so much for replying and please find the details below. 

i removed the .springBeans file from the code and build the code and ran the collector and now i can see the configurations are inserted into the db. As you mentioned i have selected the rally widget and now i can see the list of projects. i selected one project and saved the widget and now am seeing the below error in the collector log.

462899904 Okay I see you posted the new collector logs. One minute. For the project you selected in the UI. Can you confirm in Rally that it has a `TaskEstimateTotal` value? Sbrenthughes
462912832 @Sbrenthughes .. you are right.. it takes time to fetch the data but its working as expected.  i can see the data populated to rally widget. The only thing i did was removed the .springBean file from the rally collector repo and selected the rally widget.

Thank you so much for the help siva-veeraraj
462913212 No problem can we close this? Sbrenthughes
462926203 @Sbrenthughes .. I have one more doubt in github configuration. in dashboard.properties we have property 

# API token generated for basic authentication to secure APIs.
key=***********************

github collector application property contains     
# This is the key generated using the Encryption class in core
    github.key=<your-generated-key>

Is this both are same if so do i need to give the key generated through admin ui in the both the fields or the key generated through core jar as mentioned in http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/collectors.html#encryption-for-private-repos in both the fields siva-veeraraj
462940684 @Sbrenthughes 

Hi,

I gave the same key generated through UI in both the property file and it worked. Before  giving the key i have configured that repo in the widget so it showed an error like below.
![repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47429392/52668730-f08c0580-2ed9-11e9-9df6-9da01d6633fc.png)

after giving the key it started pulling the data but still that 404 error is showing in the widget.  siva-veeraraj
462960952 @Sbrenthughes ... one last question does rally collector collect the feature id details ? siva-veeraraj
463297793 I am not sure what the feature id is in Rally. I can only help with general collector setup issues in this instance.  Sbrenthughes
480403790 @siva-veeraraj - I am also facing the same issue where rally server information is not updated in mongo database, I tried dropping database, deleting .spring file and all the suggestion. Is there any specific things you performed? nitingoyal8

[],"On running the Bamboo collector it is scanning through all the plans. There is no error or exception raised. But the data is not written in mongoDB database hence it is not displayed on dashboard.

This is a bug and occurs most of the time while running collectors after system restarts. Are we working on its fix ? 



 ansha1
473276610 @ansha1 can you post the solution you found? Sbrenthughes
477777902 Can you try specifying a port for it to run on? @ansha1 has had success with this.  Sbrenthughes
485501469 @buradeshruti any update?
 Sbrenthughes
495374049 Closing due to inactivity  Sbrenthughes
462330238 If it wasn’t written to mongo then it wouldn’t have completed successfully. Your api is not pointing to the same db that the collector is pointing at. 

Option 1)
Can you open the build widget and see if there is anything in the drop down? If there isn’t proceed to option 2
Option 2)
Since this is local then remove the dbuser and db pass from the collector/api properties and try again.  Sbrenthughes
462727485 Is there any dependency of Bamboo Collector on api? The api and collector properties file have same database details. 

I have tried out both the options mentioned by you. I cannot see any data in drop down. I am using Robo 3T. I can see ""Fetched 0 record(s) in 4ms"" for this ""db.getCollection('builds').find({})"" query. 

Whereas jira collector's data is stored in database with same set of credentials. 

I removed dbuser and dbpass from both collector and api, yet the result is not getting added in database. Am I messing anything? buradeshruti
462789865 When you run `db.collectors.find()` what do you see? Sbrenthughes
462876291 please find the output of db.collectors.find(). I think properties mentioned in the property file are not updated in the DB.

463996123 Hi @Sbrenthughes,
**Following is my API properties file:**
# api.properties
dbname=dashboarddb

dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
dbreplicaset=false
#dbhostport=[host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3]

**Following is application.properties of Bamboo collector:**
dbname=dashboarddb

dbport=27017

dbreplicaset=false

bamboo.cron=0 0/1 * * * *

On executing the bamboo collector, the output of db.collector.find() is blank.. I cannot see any exception or error in the logs, yet no data is written in database. 
Can you please help me in understanding how to recover? Or are there any other steps that I am missing out?  buradeshruti
464053919 Can you try “dropping” dashboarddb? Afterwards restart the collector and api. A fix will be coming for this issue.  Unfortunately, it won’t be in the near future.  Sbrenthughes
464056358 I actually tried creating an altogether new database, that also did not help. buradeshruti
464938122 @buradeshruti  did you try creating dashboard from UI after setting up UI and api. Follow these steps after setting up dashboarddb.
1) build project Hygieia 
2) run api 
3) run UI with gulp serve 
4) from UI create a dashboard 
5) verify dashboards collection in dashboarddb. nireeshT

[],"This PR allows the UI to be served from the [Red Hat Software Collections nginx images](https://github.com/sclorg/nginx-container).  These images are not intended to run as a specified UID and as such do not have access to places like `/etc/nginx/conf.d`.

`substitute-nginx-proxy-pass.sh` is placed in `./nginx-start/` at build time to correctly set the API server hostname

`api.conf` is a `proxy_pass` snippet that is placed in `./nginx-default-cfg/` for proper routing to the API server

It is intended to be used in an openshift buildconfig such as:

Hi kurma. yours looks like git is unable to access the url. you sure if its not timed out/firewall .. might be worth trying to run from another connection.

@all if anyone can help in ^ the node issue (its already installed but why is it trying to run node/node?) thanks mirageglobe
461428383 I tried from another also...it didn't work too...

461816509 @andrewalvintran Can you look into this issue? rvema
461826494 Just an update to help.. it seems that the issue is caused by the npm plugin defined in pom.xml (UI/pom.xml)

I disabled the installation by (frontend-maven-plugin) and manually installed npm/bower/gulp as well as running gulp before mvn clean install package (run in both UI and root)
  <properties>
    <frontend-maven-plugin.skip>true</frontend-maven-plugin.skip>
  </properties>

the issue is noted in the following maven plugin (allowing running executables in maven project)
https://github.com/mojohaus/exec-maven-plugin/issues/111

Problem: node nor bower/gulp is unable to be executed via maven for some reason. manual execution is possible. mirageglobe

Are you telling the issue is because of some permission? it may not be credential as without mentioning the Repo URL in UI widget I am not seeing such exception.

Please share your thoughts. Thanks. rishi-mukherjee
461566529 With the public repo can you make some commits etc? And then run the collector. Let’s see if we can collect the data. But my suspicion is that your gitlab token isn’t working for the private repo  Sbrenthughes

[],"Hello, installed Hygieia as part of a project we have, and the idea is for Hygieia to automatically refresh the build jobs status (successful, failure, unstable and aborted) for all the build jobs run in each of the Jenkins folders/projects.
For ex, we have a Jenkins folder that represents a project in Jenkins, and for that project/folder several jobs run per day (more than 100 sometimes). We need to have all those jobs automatically loaded in Hygieia with their status.
So how can we automatically refresh each Jenkins build job status on Hygieia ? 

We checked that we can add a build widget, and after a new build job is run in Jenkins, we are able to see it listed on Hygieia to add it manually, but first we are adding a single job and second we are doing it manually. We need Hygieia to refresh that status data automatically for each Jenkins run job.

thanks",406383933,2710,How to automatically grab new build Jenkins jobs in Hygieia?,2019-02-04 15:32:30,2019-03-28 21:25:00,closed,3,manuq21,"460305381 We have a Hygieia Jenkins Publisher Plugin, you could leverage that. The plugin needs to be installed on all Jenkins masters and that way all the build information can be pushed from Jenkins to Hygieia on a event basis. This will eliminate the need to run Jenkins Collector. Do let me know if you need help. rvema
460307712 Hi rvema, we have the ""Hygieia Publisher Plugin"" installed in Jenkins, is that the one ?
Description of it: This plugin is publisher that can publish build status to Hygieia Dashboard.

If that's the one, do you have the specific steps to get it worked as you said, instead of using the Hygieia build collector ? 

BTW, we are looking to automatically see on a Hygieia dashboard, all the build jobs that Jenkins is able to push in real time.

Thanks!  manuq21

458694431 I appreciate it @rvema. nsaud01
458715131 here is the correct query `db.getCollection('apitoken').find({""apiUser"":""hygieia""})` rvema

458721707 looks like somehow there is an issue with authentication at the mongodb. Can you walk me through how you setup your mongo db so that I can find any missing pieces. rvema
458728377 Here is my compose file settings. I'm using a vanilla mongodb docker image, not the one included with the Hygieia project.

458732595 I need to recreate this scenario as we run mongo in a standalone mode. rvema
458810396 @nsaud01 There was a PR merged earlier fixing some of the docker configuration for Hygieia. Can you get the latest code from Hygieia workspace and retry? rvema
459014349 I'm getting the following error when running `mvn clean install package` on the api. I successfully ran `mvn clean install` on the core project and root of `Hygieia`.

459019208 Let me check and get back. We had a successful build last night. Meanwhile can you post the maven version and jdk version here  rvema
459045046 @nsaud01 can you get the latest from master branch now and retry. The fix has been merged. rvema
459060186 Looks like the fix solved the issue! My maven and jdk versions are as follows:

Maven 3.6.0
JDK 1.8.0_191 nsaud01
459078925 Regarding the mongo installation, Have you tried mongo as a standalone service and retry? There was a PR (#2694 ) to help with configuration with standalone mongo instead of running it in a container. rvema
459133559 I haven't tried a standalone mongo instance. My goal is to get it up and running in a container. So far everything but the api token seems to be working. I'll dig in more and let you know what I find. :) nsaud01
459141140 @nsaud01 you are able to create an account and login via ui, correct?
I see you can, now.  Sbrenthughes
459154493 @Sbrenthughes that is correct. nsaud01
459405117 I am getting this error in the api logs:

```` nsaud01
459541981 Usually that happens when the api has restarted and the UI is trying to pass an invalid token. Clear the cache on the UI 

Also, check gitter I have direct messaged you.  Sbrenthughes
461172151 The `JWT signature does not match locally computed signature` error was indeed a caching issue. I'm still not able to authenticate to the api after the latest api build. nsaud01
463643179 @nsaud01  use the method here to get make token http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/api.html#basic-authentication-for-secure-apis. `echo PasswordIsAuthToken:{""apikey"":""<api-token-generated>""} | base64` doesn't generate the correct way. This is the problem. Sbrenthughes

My jenkins is running on version 2.114, is there any compatibility concerns with old version on jenkins ? 
---------------------------------
Suggestion : It would be really helpful, if you can upload video tutorials on youtube with basic understanding. Hygieia is amazing tool but very complicated when you configure it. 
---------------------------------------
@Sbrenthughes can we have a webex or something so that we can fix it quickly and i can have better understanding ?

[] is for me poojithkumar
463300126 @poojithkumar that is because, based on the other 2 issues you have open, you haven't successfully ran the collector yet. 

@ansha1 thank you for responding with your fix. I apologize for not getting back sooner.

458008865 Thanks for responding @Sbrenthughes !
I have tried same command, its not showing that drop down list of jobs i have in jenkins. My jenkins instance is having 16 project folders and 2 jobs on home page. Why its interacting with jenkins but not able to fetch jobs to dashboard. I tried restarting UI and API, tried logging out and page refresh as well. 

Also can you clear above mentioned doubts please. Do we need to launch collectors each time we restart UI and API ? 
Also after collectors do we need to restart UI to reflect data ? is there any way we can automate some of our required collectors as a service so we just have to run a script to relaunch all our required set of collectors and features in hygieia.

Please help me to fix above issues.

458161504 The collector only collectors build information once a build has been tied to a dashboard. If you are not seeing any builds in the drop down then either your api or your collector is pointing to the wrong db. 

Can you paste your api properties here as well? 

Collectors need to run continually to refresh data. UI and API only need to be restarted when there are updates. Sbrenthughes

Suggestion : It would be really helpful, if you can upload video tutorials on youtube with basic understanding. Hygieia is amazing tool but very complicated when you configure it.

@Sbrenthughes can we have a webex or something so that we can fix it quickly and i can have better understanding ?

[],"1. APM (Dynatrace)

As we continue our journey towards continuous delivery we realized that if we can have the performance test results published to Hygieia it will help the teams to review the quality and performance of the code in a single place.

Different teams use different APM solutions out of which the prominent names are Appdynamics, Dynatrace etc. Our use case is dynatrace. Is there any plan to make a widget that will be available on the dashboard to which we can integrate dynatrace results (Performance Test). Is this a capability that is already available ?

[],"Have been tracking down the source of a frustrating issue where Jenkins build collector doesn't seem to respect settings from configuration.

Commented out these lines from the `properties-builder.sh` and it resolved the issue

```
if [ ""$TEST_SCRIPT"" != """" ]
then
        #for testing locally
        PROP_FILE=application.properties
else
	PROP_FILE=config/hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties
fi
```

It would seem this would allow for the properties file to be created in the wrong location. Where the config would be written to `config/hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties` but the application will be started with 

```
--spring.config.location=$PROP_FILE
```
Where `$PROP_FILE` is provided by the Dockerfile as `ENV PROP_FILE /hygieia/config/application.properties`",401551778,2681,Inconsistencies in docker property-builder script causing unexpected failure due to misconfiguration,2019-01-22 00:23:27,2019-01-25 18:43:49,open,5,spyoungtech,"456233165 Also noteworthy is that this ""local testing"" block doesn't appear in all the collectors' `properties-builder.sh`. 

Similar code is found in scripts for xldeploy, appdynamics, and gitlab. I don't use those collectors, but presumably, this problem would exist for those using these collectors with docker-compose. spyoungtech
456245114 Please see MatthewBeasley’s comment here: https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/issues/2489. It describes how to override the properties file. 

But we do need to update the documentation and make it consistent across the collectors. Also, there will be an over haul of the docker setup contributed back to the project soon. So stay tuned.  Sbrenthughes
456246755 Thanks for that link @Sbrenthughes . Looking forward to changes in the docker setup.

I have a couple reservations about overriding the environment variable, particularly because the `PROP_FILE` variable in the shell script can change based on the presence of this `TEST_SCRIPT` environment variable, and will change regardless of what value is supplied in the environment variable.

In other words, I believe these lines in `properties-builder.sh` to be harmful. Yes, one can override the dockerfile default location to accommodate, but that is treating the symptom rather than root cause.

The Dockerfile cmd will always start the app with the location in environment variable; behaves as expected. The properties-builder script will not respect the environment variable, which is the root cause of this issue.

I would suggest that the environment variable be respected in all cases and that instead of using those lines in the shell script... A tester should override the environment variable instead of using a separate variable `TEST_SCRIPT`.

Also weird that I'd need to do this environment variable override for just these few collectors, which is why it seems (in my view) like a bug that should be fixed, rather than documenting a workaround. spyoungtech
457286467 Thanks for your work, @Sbrenthughes .

Agree with @spyoungtech . Which is why I never did the PR for documentation - I felt that it should be fixed rather than workaround documented. 

Glad to see it will be addressed in the Docker setup overhaul.  daniel-ng
457408852 Also noticed that api-audit properties file contains a similar issue. The propfile location is hard-coded:

 Sharmakartik
456105007 Do you have any sonar projects? Because the collector isn’t pulling anything. Also, it would be under codeanalysis.

Also, please refrain from using “cant see Quality widget
HELP!!!”. These clutter the thread and provide no value.  Sbrenthughes

[],"Fix grid resizing for the Quality Widget (Static Analysis)
- Added Bootstrap grid layout to the widgets so that they properly resize

Additional addition for adding ""No data found"" for all widgets where data does not exist.
- Created a directive to determine whether or not a widget is empty
- Check if all values in the widget (passed in through an array) are null, meaning the widget is empty
- Add ""No data found"" message to the widget to replace empty data
        - If graphs have sections within, the header is kept with ""No data found"" displayed underneath
        - If no data exists at all, the entire widget is shown as ""No data found""
- added comments on how to properly use the ""hideEmpty"" directive

Small formatting fixes on various widgets (mostly quality and feature)
- Updated formatting on feature widget to create more defined spacing between sections
- Removed ""No iterations found"" on feature widget and replaced with ""No data found"" for consistency
- Updated spacing on quality widget so that ""No data found"" formats match across all tabs

456149135 The error seems to indicate it's trying `localhost:27017`. Make sure you're building the container with your properties. If you're using `docker-compose`, there's the `properties-builder.sh` that can configure your collector app.properties based on environment variables. spyoungtech

Removing the `if TEST_SCRIPT` code from properties-builder.sh seemed to do the trick for me. spyoungtech

453710477 @kalpanaparthasarathy could you try running jenkins without tomcat and then try Sbrenthughes
453889837 Sure.. Since it didn't work through CLI deployment, I tried using Tomcat.Will again try the former one and let you know the results.. kalpanaparthasarathy
453890839 What command are you using to start the Jenkins server? Sbrenthughes
453907234 I mean Jenkins has started fine via Cli..The command used was
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8081
Still I was not able to view the trend.As  attached above,got those Api 401 Authentication errors in Jenkins job console.
So thought of starting the Jenkins using tomcat.But no luck.
Same authentication errors have occurred. kalpanaparthasarathy
454070180 Have you pulled the latest API? This error can happen if you are using the latest plugin without updating to the latest API  Sbrenthughes
454250412 Oh..Currently I have Hygieia 3.0.1 Release source code.Earlier I updated my plugin version alone.Will try with the latest API package. kalpanaparthasarathy
454768606 Hello sbrenthughes and Ragha,
Able to view the build data via plugin with latest Hygieia repo.But still deploy widget couldn't be configured.
Not able to view the application name in the dropdown of deploy widget.
In the Post build actions of my job,enabled 3 functions by following #884
1.Publish Build starts--It works fine..
2.Publish Artifact information--->Doesn't work..
3.Publsih Deployment Results--->doesn't work either..
So for 2 & 3, Passed inputs like artifact dir,pattern,group..But below every text box,There is an error message saying like
HTTP ERROR 404

Problem accessing /job/AutoDeploy/descriptorByName/jenkins.plugins.hygieia.HygieiaPublisher/checkValue. Reason:

Not Found

453368182 Found some interesting things with Jira apis. For example https://jira.xxxxxxxxx.com/rest/agile/1.0/board/17/issue returns issues assigned to project A (say) but https://jira.xxxxxxxxx.com/rest/agile/1.0/board/17/project  may or may not return project A depending upon how stuff is setup by users. I will be changing some more code .. arghh tabladrum
453396290 First i clone https://github.com/tabladrum/hygieia-core and install
then git checkout 3935d364613e5f13aac3f772647822611cecd999   build success

I use 3935d364613e5f13aac3f772647822611cecd999 in test env.

How can i use board as team?

 yamazakei331
453516644 When you clone the core just run mvn clean install. No need to checkout commit ids etc. I’d worry about getting the core to build correctly first. 

The collector is designed to detect the plugin used for teams as boards. Are you saying your jira has the plugin but is not using it?  Sbrenthughes
453526544 Looks like we still need the ability to have user decide if they want team or board even if tempo team is enabled. Working on it this morning. Will update the issue as soon as I am done. tabladrum
453539999 This is my step:
git clone https://github.com/tabladrum/hygieia-core.git   cd hygieia-core   mvn clean install package     build success
git clone https://github.com/tabladrum/Hygieia.git  cd Hygieia mvn clean install package -Dmaven.test.skip build fail

453542799 Yes,my jira server has tempo plugin,but it is not active. Properties of feature.jiraBoardAsTeam is useful for me. yamazakei331
453546684 Pushed latest to my fork. Get both hygieia-core and Hygieia. Add ``feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true`` to your  properties file. Also add this property to refresh your team/board and project info ``feature.refreshTeamAndProjectHours=4`` -> in my case I want to refresh team/board and project every 4 hours since the last refresh. tabladrum

453707160 @yamazakei331 that is the risk you run. If you have verified that the board exist then it in order for it to be pulled then you must be given the permissions. Unfortunately there is no other way around that. Sbrenthughes

453714946 ok, another bug.. I think .. I need to quote each type Story and Epic etc instead of quoting all together. Hold on. tabladrum
453715232 @Sbrenthughes please add the above - ie, fetching multiple issue types - in your test case. tabladrum
453715315 And epic,story use different api

453717453 epic is also a valid issuetype. hmmm :-).. looking more.. tabladrum
453717935 Can you take the latest? I see that issues have epics in them too. something like below. This may not be sufficient as epics without issues will not be here? I will check again tomorrow morning.
 ```

                ""customfield_12409"": null,

453735074 Hello Guys, I know this is  be invalid request but from user point of view i feel there should good documentation about how to get the field name details. It took me a while to understand the field names and how to get them from my jira account. It would be great if we have a detailed documentation about jira collector. Thank you for providing an awesome tool MummanaSubramanya
453788492 @yamazakei331 working on the epic status. Jira deleted issue is a problem - I was looking at at Jira's user forums. I may have a way to do to do sync up with while doing full refresh.  tabladrum
453896056 Updated my fork to handle epic status. Testing in progress ->
 https://github.com/tabladrum/hygieia-core and https://github.com/tabladrum/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature/jira  tabladrum
454047927 Up to lastest ,but epic not work correct.An epic is done,the data in DB is done,but the epic still in the UI panel.

another bug,
I use hours for estimate metric,add a story with 4d (32h),but in UI it show 1920,i think it use minutes instead of hours

455873489 Reverting to c692842 works though? Sbrenthughes
456110963 Test in c692842a393c6cc49feba4abef4823a5968d3e00,it works.
And the bug ""estimate metric "" was fixed yamazakei331
456238504 It would be really nice if this widget could be configured with just a JQL query or saved filter from Jira, instead of needing to tie to particular projects/boards and issue types.

To me, this would be a more simple, intuitive, and flexible configuration and shouldn't require users to figure out the custom field ids for their instance. spyoungtech

It is not taking data/stories created before. How can I fetch data or stories which were created a week back.
 syedafirdaus
456985671 You’ll need to delete scope, team, and feature documents. As well as the jira collector in the collector document then start the collector  Sbrenthughes
457038343 I dropped the whole db and started fresh. Still don't see any data in UI. It just shows 0 0 0 syedafirdaus
457038608 Can you verify you have the correct custom fields? Sbrenthughes
457043467 YEs I did. They are correct. When I cloned the original Hygieia repo and ran jira collector I could fetch all data and also I rechecked in db as well. Data was present. But while running jira collector i got below error
ERROR c.c.d.c.story.StoryDataClientImpl - Failed to obtain sprint data from [""com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint

 Unparsable sprint: com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@3afa495e[

I have rechecked all the fields and they are fine. I dont know where i am missing.  syedafirdaus
457053481 @syedafirdaus your log says it collected data since Jan 23 2019. Get the code from my fork, delete the jira collector from collectors collection, delete scope, teams and features collection. Rerun the collector after building from my fork.  tabladrum
457056156 Can you please tell me which fork exactly?  syedafirdaus
457067490 https://github.com/tabladrum/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature/jira tabladrum
457094973 I did that, And I still face same issue. It always tries to take data from the time I start running collector

I also noticed error in api
2019-01-24 07:25:44,989 ERROR c.c.d.rest.RestApiExceptionHandler - null

Any idea?

Is there anything where I can change to collect previous data and not the time i start collector.
The collector started like this

2019-01-24 07:24:00,041 INFO  c.c.d.collector.FeatureCollectorTask - JIRA Collector is set to work in Board mode

452654347 I think there is some problem with jiraTeamFieldName and jiraBoardAsTeam fields... but to my knowledge i have set them correctly... We don't use boards as team so i set that to false...and I get the value of 15870 when i check the 'Team' ..

Please help @Sbrenthughes  .. Thanks!! udiakasnuke
452876936 @udiakasnuke We are in the testing phase of a rewrite for the Jira collector. Stay tuned.  Sbrenthughes
453117220 Two options: 
immediately: set the last boolean property ""feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true""
coming up soon: a complete rewrite of the collector to account for data correctness, performance - you can take a look at my fork: https://github.com/tabladrum/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature/jira 
You also need to locally clone and ""mvn clean install"" on hygieia-core from my fork - https://github.com/tabladrum/hygieia-core tabladrum
453709133 Please refer to the above comment and if you face issues follow up here #2667.  Sbrenthughes
458299757 @tabladrum Upon running your forked Jira collector, I'm running into an error I was hoping you could clarify.

453804585 I have gone through that and found that  If your test case results are a cucumber format file, it is supported.
But if I don't have my result in cucumber format then how can I publish my functional test result in Quality Widget.
Do I need to create a custom collector for that ?
@tabladrum Please share your ideas.  anayyadav

still i don't see build data in mongodb?.... clearing the browser cache is resolving the JWT issue though.. udiakasnuke

446713219 Can you paste the collector logs Sbrenthughes
446779128 When you go to mongo do you see anything in the build document? And there are no builds in the drop down on the build widget? Sbrenthughes
446884693 @Sbrenthughes  - Yes i do see some data... approx 156 entries but all those entries corresponds to 1 build plan.. I have many plans in my bamboo. Not all the data is saved here. But surprisingly if i configure a Build widget and in drop down menu for entering the build plan i can search for all the plans but the entries for those plans are not present in mongodb. udiakasnuke
446957968 Select a plan in the widget and the run the collector again  Sbrenthughes
446961462 Is it supposed to be like this?? I mean after adding a plan in UI and saving we need to start collector again..?? udiakasnuke
446990514 It is a collector.. it needs to run on a schedule.. This is how you would get updated data to hygieia. Sbrenthughes
447399661 @udiakasnuke any update? Sbrenthughes

[],"Hi, actually we have 2 questions.
1. we need to create product dashboard by remoteCreate, but I've read through Hygieia Swagger API page and have drilled down into api source code, it seems that Hygieia hadn't implement remoteCreating product dashboard now.
2. we want to remoteCreate a pipeline widget in the team dashboard, just like above, I guess it's not implemented yet.
Just want to make sure if this is the case, if so, do we have any roadmap about remoteCreating product dashboard? And do we have any workaround now?
Really appreciate your help.",389531096,2629,Can we remoteCreate a product dashboard?,2018-12-10 23:25:17,2019-01-15 18:54:50,closed,1,liutsi,"451279905 You are correct it doesn't exist. Currently there are no plans to implement this in the near future. Sbrenthughes

[],"We are publishing deploy environment data to our hygieia stack using the Jenkins plugin. For example:

```
hygieiaDeployPublishStep applicationName: ""${APP_NAME}"", artifactDirectory: 'dist/', artifactGroup: 'uncontained.io', artifactName: 'index.html', artifactVersion: ""${BUILD_NUMBER}-${dev_namespace}"", buildStatus: 'Success', environmentName: ""${dev_namespace}""
```

However, the team dashboard cannot calculate average lead time because the build and deploy widgets don't have the commit information in them. Is there some way to explicitly send a commit id in the publish steps?

Your deploy steps don’t need commit data. You need to push the artifact data in the build and then once you do your first deploy with that same artifact name, version etc the commit data will automatically sync up. If this isn’t happening you are missing a step.

445877090 Another observation.. one of my jenkinsfiles pulls in a global library from github, and the build widget is interpretting that as my source code repository, and pulling commit data from it.

You should update your documentations about the fix you suggested above. It passed the last failure step for missing jar. Right now its failing for bower install, because i used root user for checking out code and running maven. Well i am creating a new user and will build again. 
I will update here once its done.

446847682 You should enable it for root as well. Will ease our work :)  ansha1
447008181 We have a backlog item to update the documentation.

What do you mean enable it for root?  Sbrenthughes

I cloned Hygieia core and when I run ""mvn clean install"" , the build is failing with the below error:

_org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: You need to run build with JDK or have tools.jar on the classpath.If this occures during eclipse build make sure you run eclipse under JDK as well_

Can you please help ?? I am using windows machine, tried in unix box as well .. same error.

463613944 Hi ,
I am using lastest version of hygieia-jenkins publisher

I have configured as you mentioned in above comments. And i dont have a deploy tool. I use Jenkins to deploy using shell script. I have added deployment in post-build actions like below. Still I cannot see env in Hygieia pipeline view.
I have also set feature.dynamicPipeline=enabled in api properties file
FYI all screenshots

454210205 Hi. I have just recently used Hygieia in setting up a consolidated dashboard for our project. Currently I am working on the deploy widget but I have been having the same problem as above. The artifact part in Hygieia Publisher always yields a Not found error. I would very much appreciate any assistance in resolving this.

I am currently using the latest code and (plugin 2.1.8) with JDK version 1.8.0_191.

443802747 what should i do next??
 Sharmakartik
443813181 I'm getting the same thing as @Sharmakartik . The issue seems to be coming from the `api-audit/pom.xml` file:

https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/master/api-audit/pom.xml#L82

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>[3.1.0-SNAPSHOT,)</version>
        </dependency>
```

For comparison, the `api/pom.xml` file has the same dependency, but pointing to what appears to be a valid version:

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.7.4</version>

442808332 I'm really not sure on the number of plans..  But when you configure your project in build (bamboo) widget.. it takes some time to load the data.. In my case I have seen this issue. vishnuvangala
442819346 I couldnt see my project or Build Job to configure the widget, other plans/jobs are getting displayed. Even I couldnt see my job/plan related to my project in the bamboo collector logs. 

I can see, its collecting plan names starting with the letter A to E but not after that.. murugaops
443738240 It’s possible that it needs to implement some sort paging functionality. Is that something you can work on and contribute back? Sbrenthughes

- `-v ./mongo:/data/db` won't work because you must first create a `mongo` dir and set `-v $PWD/mongo:/data/db` instead of `-v ./mongo:/data/db` (can't use relative paths) 

- after exec'ing into the container `docker exec -t -i mongodb bash` , you must run `mongo` before `use dashboarddb` 

- **Step 3**, which asks you to set Env. Variables, mounting logs file has the same issue as the first point with relative volume paths


I'm unable to get past Step 3 .. Getting timeout issues with mongo and other dep issues
