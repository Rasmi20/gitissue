[],"I'm running this locally on Windows 10 and do not have access to Gitter at work.  I have built everything but cannot get a collector working at all.  What I've done:

1) First I tried running just the api with  java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=""..\..\dashboard.properties"" and the UI with gulp serve --local true.  I saw the dashboard but there was no data and I could not create any users.  I saw some earlier issues suggesting that the mock data model may be broken so I tried to configure a GitHub (Enterprise) collector.

2) I created application.properties for GitHub and tried to run the collector from the \target folder like this:
java -jar github-scm-collector-3.0.1.jar --spring.config.name=github --spring.config.location=c:\code\hygieia\collectors\scm\github\application.properties

I get an error: ""Exception authenticating MongoCredential ... userName='dashboarduser', source='dashboarddb' ...""

I confirmed that MongoDB is running on the default port and that the dashboarddb and dashboarduser exist.  Password is just ""test123"" and is set as such in properties file.  Questions:

- what should I try next?
- once I fix this error, should I manually start the collector, api, UI in that order?  

Thanks!",384527915,2604,Unable to get started with a basic collector.,2018-11-26 21:57:50,2018-11-30 15:55:55,closed,10,freecellwiz,"442619163 To clarify, when I ran with --local true what happened is that user creation failed.  It would just return me to the signup screen then on try #2 tell me the user existed.  I found issues where other people had this happen but didn't see an answer.  If I can get a real collector running I don't really care about the test data :-) freecellwiz
442619804 Are you getting the mongo error while running the GitHub collector? Sbrenthughes
443216625 Yes, the Mongo error is while running the collector.  I tried a few things and made some progress:

* When I run the GitHub collector I get ""Exception authenticating MongoCredential{mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1, userName='dashboarduser', source='dashboarddb', password="" 
* If I run the collector with the db user/pwd commented out in application.properties, it runs (no repo data is pulled yet but it's hitting GitHub - I can solve that part)
* I also commented out the db user/pwd in dashboard.properties for consistency, but now the login screen is missing the form.  

A bit later today (I'm at work) I may just trying deleting and creating the database in case I've gotten something in a bad state somehow.  I would like to understand the user/pwd issue.   freecellwiz
443218696 The login screen missing is likely a browser cache issue. Clear your browser cache or open in incognito mode. Are we good to close this? Sbrenthughes
443246191 Yes, thanks.  If I have other questions I'll use Gitter when I'm outside a corporate network. freecellwiz
442079505 Can you post your properties file? Sbrenthughes
442149455 Sure.  I'm probably missing something obvious.

442456639 Can you verify whether or not you are able to create a new user via the ui? Sbrenthughes
442610399 Hi Brent - 

Actually yes I can.  I was thrown earlier because when running --local true it didn't work.  If I run just the API in one command window and the UI in a second (just ""gulp serve"") I can create an admin user and get ""Welcome ADMIN"".  

Now I just need to get a collector working to get an idea of how the tool works and if it will help our teams.  It looks fantastic.  GitHub was just the one I picked as a test.  Our stack includes GitHub Enterprise/TeamCity/Artifactory/Jira.  I don't know if it matters that we use self-hosted GH and not github.com.

 freecellwiz
442611695 It does not matter. I just wanted to make sure it was setup from the ui/api side. Since this is local, can you comment out the db user and db password and re run the collector? Sbrenthughes

# Please provide a string name reference to your instance's IssueType for
# the lowest level of Issues (for example, 'user story') specific to your Jira
# instance.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's IssueType Name

438897093 Sure. I will send a PR.

Adding a field requires a change in hygieia-core. So, shall I send a pull request to that project first, And then sending another PR here with the change of module `api`?

Or, in another approach, I can modify `api` module to accept a custom request object by extending the core request class `CodeQualityCreateRequest` and use it within two rest end points. This will require a PR only to this project.

439181288 @Naveenraaj : There seems to be an issue with the response coming back for the build URL https://jenkinsurl/job/4/consoleText.

Would you be able to run the collector in your IDE in debug mode, and put a break point in the class ""DefaultHudsonClient.java"" class on the line 313 (ResponseEntity<String> result = makeRestCall(url)), and see what response you are getting back? May be this url is not valid. subodhsbattina

444432190 It is a job for compiling .Net code, 

Explaining further...
I can see all the jobs from the folder(which i am trying to bring it in to dashboard), when i try to configure(build reports) in a new dashboard , as a drop down list
the problem is--
when i choose certain jobs, i get null pointer exception and when i choose certain job, it loads up the report graph as expected.

P.S. i have access to browse/build all the jobs from Jenkins GUI and access them through rest API through the appropriate URLs.

Any suggestion for me to proceed further, would be great !! Naveenraaj

I'm working on adding OAuth2 support to the jenkins collector, and I'm trying to build the collector image so I can deploy it to openshift.  I had to hack the collector's `pom.xml` a lot to get it to build, as it depends on the top-level `pom.xml`.  I also edited the collector's `Dockerfile` to do a `mvn install`.  

Hoping to not butcher the `pom.xml` too much, I tried just running the image from the top level `Hygieia` directory, passing in the path to the `Dockerfile` I wanted.  When trying to use the maven structure as-is, running `docker build -f collector/build/jenkins/docker/Dockerfile`, I get messages about the `maven-surefire` plugin crashing, though it appears that it is only defined in the `UI-Tests` module.  

Admittedly, I do not have a lot of maven experience, I mostly use and and gradle, and I'm sure that there are good  reasons for the hierarchical project structure.  I'm wondering if there are any plans to:

+ Have the `Dockerfiles` actually build the binaries they expect to see in `dist`, `target`, etc.
+ As a consequence of this, it will probably be necessary to make the maven projects more independent of each other",378403503,2560,Dockerfiles do not build the code,2018-11-07 17:59:55,2018-12-06 02:04:40,closed,2,tomgeorge,"436843866 I did a little more reading, and found out that the `-pl` option exists in Maven, so I can use that to just build one module.  

Re: the builder images, this might be just a specific use case, but I still think there would be value in creating them for e.g. containerized CI systems, developer onboarding, openshift imagestreams and buildconfigs, etc. tomgeorge

I would like the build parameters added to the stored values so we may sort, categorize, and display info for a build based on the build parameters passes into that job.  

This seems like it should be a List objects return similar to how codeRepos or sourceChangeSet are stored in the mongoDB.

484638059 @poojithkumar looks like you haven't installed the core properly. To do that checkout my branch of the core that is referenced in this PR and do a `mvn clean install`. This puts the core into the local repository and your build of the main Hygieia project should be able to be completed in the normal way. stevegal
503197075 @stevegal Where are you at with these two PRs? OneMoreByte
503228498 Well, what I have in place basically works (or did a while ago). I’m not sure that the main team want to follow the approach taken (I’m sure @rvema will provide confirm), so it leaves this pr in limbo atm.
I think it has highlighted that there is demand for this feature though.  stevegal

@stevegal I will test the new changes this Friday and come back to you with comments/feedback. dardanbekteshi
437614602 Hi @stevegal, some observations from testing the PR on my local setup:

- Deletion
Deleting a widget doesn't currently work, in particular the below for loop removes all collectorItems of a given collectorType. https://github.com/stevegal/Hygieia/blob/5206b98383a8aa8151e8a9d6d42f8f0cdff59702/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DashboardServiceImpl.java#L577-L579
![delete_feature_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/48305142-d2eb8080-e525-11e8-98d1-8a9006c24ea5.PNG)
![delete_build_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/48305145-d848cb00-e525-11e8-91d0-4bcb4fe0e649.PNG)
As you can see, when one deletes a widget of one type, all the other widgets ""lose"" the data instantly.
Can maybe these changes from my branch be helpful?https://github.com/dardanbekteshi/Hygieia/blob/8f126a8ef8c2f2cab6cfc54346c7ab74f6198cae/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DashboardServiceImpl.java#L540-L550
https://github.com/dardanbekteshi/Hygieia/blob/8f126a8ef8c2f2cab6cfc54346c7ab74f6198cae/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DashboardServiceImpl.java#L569

-  Build widget creation & update
The first widget creation works fine. When trying to create and/or update the 2nd one, the ""creation"" widget gets prefilled with the options of the 1st build.
![build_2_creation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/48305218-172b5080-e527-11e8-84d4-872e102052df.PNG)
Basically the 1st textbox **BuildJob** always takes the value of the 1st widget's job and you need to manually change it even after an update of an already defined 2nd widget.
**Note**: the two other options, alert criteria and threshold work fine (as expected).

- Repo widget
Similar problem as in Build. When creating the 2nd widget, all the options get prefilled from the 1st widget. 
![repo_2_creation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/48305327-0da2e800-e529-11e8-91c1-f05f5c67db71.PNG)
When trying to update a Repo widget, a weird thing happens. The API token gets revealed! but I think this has been a problem before the multiple widget feature. 
![api_token_revealed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/48305395-f1ec1180-e529-11e8-9939-e7a16a1d2185.PNG)

 dardanbekteshi
437632558 @dardanbekteshi thanks for the detailed report and the code suggestions. My preference (as yours) is to work collaboratively on this... It is a relatively big job for just interested parties to commit to. I know you opened up your fork to PRs first but I had made a bit of progress... I'm willing to work either way on this (me contributing to your PR or vice-versa), I can't wait for this to work as it opens up so suck flexibility to people to use this how they want. Just let me know how you want to proceed (your fork or mine!). 
Thanks again! stevegal
437679803 @stevegal It is indeed a relatively big task and I think you made a good point.  
I have no problem on working on either fork, IMO what matters is to join forces, the other stuff is just details. But I'd suggest we work on your branch since that is the one with the highest activity.    dardanbekteshi
443849306 Hi,
  I need the same thing, how is this progressing ? msoyer78
443854996 @msoyer78 - so far so good. Basic functionality is present as I started on create dashboard first, but I'm working on update/delete widgets at the moment. It's slow as I'm working on it in only when I have free time. Anyway... check it out and let me know what you think. stevegal
459964888 NOTE: MUST NOW BE BUILT WITH A BRANCH OF HYGIEIA-CORE (see PR:  https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core/pull/40) stevegal
461890301 Editing dashboards now possible
<img width=""1037"" alt=""screenshot 2019-02-08 at 17 56 04"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11609951/52496333-f37db200-2bca-11e9-9726-7c24f20be59d.png"">

Repo config now sorted to pull in its config and not master. Delete should also work
 stevegal
461890977 @rvema @matthewbeasley I'm not sure how much further I can take this with my limited collector options. You can see what I do with the repo widget, basically query for the collectorItem and fill in from there. What do you think? stevegal
473384132 This has merge conflicts on the branch as well as compiler errors. We should remediate those before considering pulling this in. chtompki
473391801 I’ve raised an equivalent pr on the core project as well and pointed that out in the comments above. It requires modifications on both sides stevegal
476858546 @chtompki @stevegal This a great contribution. How soon can we complete/merge this PR? shishirchaturvedi
476862210 We’ll want to resolve #2766 (I have an idea here that I’ll ask about tomorrow) before hand. But we agree chtompki
476875323 I filled in the old contributors agreement if that helps things? stevegal
479439017 @stevegal  is any one collectors support for mutiple widget now ?
   poojithkumar
479556393 I think I’ve done most ui widgets, but can’t be sure they work as I don’t have the ability to test them all out manually  stevegal
479748463 change core dependency like this in all pom files
<dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

widget number counting all widget of same type created in all. it should start from 1 if other is deleted poojithkumar
479830755 @stevegal  Is there any way to change widget name in view file ? i want name of the widget as a component name . that's more meaningful name than numbers.


thanks  poojithkumar
479995401 @poojithkumar yeah... it would be quite easy I think to update the names.But it's already a big PR without adding even more to it.

The dropped data if you delete one widget... does that relate to all widgets or just particular types? I thought I solved it for a few of them, so I'd be interested to know which I've missed (or indeed if any work!).

And just to make sure... did you do a `mvn clean install ` from the https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-core/pull/40 

Thanks stevegal
480020004 If u suggest the method to do so .it will be great help for me. (Plz share
advice) #2818
I tried only for build widget.

Thanks  in advance.

1. Collector
2. UI widget
3. REST Endpoints to query aggregated data

**Hygieia Collector** is a Spring Boot process designed to collect & aggregate DevOps data and persist it to datastore(Default - MongoDB). You can take a look at [SCM collector](https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/scm/github) to understand how a collector is implemented. 

**UI Widgets** are maintained [here]( https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/tree/master/UI/src/components/widgets). You can follow these widgets and create similar code for new widget. For example you can copy repo folder and rename to ""AZURE_BUILD_WIDGET"". Each widget in Hygieia is uniquely identified by its name. During widget creation widget name is passed in the REST API call and that way REST API can resolve its name by mapping it to a predertmined itentifier. An example [widget name](https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/components/widgets/repo/config.js#L215) which is mapped to Collector type SCM [here]( https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/DashboardServiceImpl.java#L590).

**REST Endpoints** are created as Spring Controller, please see [GitRequestController](https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/rest/GitRequestController.java). You need to supply ComponentID and some more parameter unique to your widget. 

Other than above, you can find plethora of information on Hygieia by following its [online documentation](https://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/getting_started.html).

[],"As part of the Hygieia planning session at Verizon this past summer, SingleStone committed to working on a few new features. This one relates to simplifying the initial setup of Hygieia.
 
**Problem:** 
The initial installation and configuration of Hygieia is time consuming and requires many steps and tools to be installed (e.g. Java, Maven, Node, gulp, Mongo, etc.). From personal experience this can take 1-3 hours depending on the installers familiarity with all the tools listed above. Based on a discussion with @tabladrum, this is one of the largest sources of issues from the Hygieia community and solving this issue would result in less support issues being generated.
 
**Outcomes:** 
A new user can get Hygieia up and running in less than 10 minutes (from initial download to dashboard created and being populated with real data).
 
**Design Thoughts:**
1. Reasonable defaults should be used so streamlined installation can support ~100 teams or dashboards out of the box with minimal/no configuration. More sophisticated highly available and fault-tolerant installations are beyond the initial scope.
1. When Hygieia is “run” this means the UI, API and the default set of collectors required to populate the default dashboard are automatically started from a single command. 
1. Ideally the user can configure which collectors are started in a simple way and/or the can shutoff previously started collectors quickly.
1. The approach should be cloud-native, but support on premise / local installations too.

**Design Options:**
**Docker Hub** - A publicly available image containing all the software necessary to run Hygieia pre-installed. Users would install with “docker pull hygieia” and run with “docker run hygieia”. This image would include all the current “capitalone/hygieia-*” repos currently published on [hub.docker.com](hub.docker.com) (basically the UI, API and reasonable default set of collectors in a single image).

**AWS ECS & EKS** - Similar to above, this would enable a user with an AWS account to launch Hygieia in a managed environment. To launch, the user would choose the Hygieia image, create a task definition, configure the service and cluster before launching. 

**Hygieia AMI** - A baked AMI published to the AWS Marketplace with all Hygieia components installed that is used to stand-up a new instance. Once a user logs into their AWS account, from the marketplace, they specify the Action Type, EC2 instance size, VPC, Subnet, Security Group and Key Pair then clicks Launch to start the server.

**Next Steps**
This issues is meant to start a discussion in this community on how to proceed forward. Before writing code, we want to tease out other requirements, ideas and options on how this might be done before implementing it (likely starting in December). ",374643059,2537,Streamline Hygieia Onboarding,2018-10-27 13:03:21,2019-02-19 19:32:33,open,6,ryanshriver,"434759557 Love the Installation Generator idea. The generator itself can generate the properties file for the collectors or even register hooks (such as github webhook). This may be interesting https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/99  tabladrum
434792704 I like the Installation Generator idea too. I think one of the primary advantages to an approach like that would be the ability to vet the inputs that the user provides, alerting them when there are issues with the information provided. Although this approach would be somewhat limited in it's ability to scale as you need to follow the GHE appliance model where all layers exist on the same instance, image, etc, but I think it would be very good for small to medium sized consumers.  matthewbeasley
434913831 So along the Installation Generator idea, I think we should focus on a few main threads, perhaps in parallel:

First, we should figure out how to ask natural questions about how the user wants Hygieia to help them and capture their answers in a meaningful format for use later. I'm happy to help here but would like to pair with @tabladrum or some others to flush this out a bit. Might pull in Kevin Tuskey here too.

Second, we should figure out how to translate their answers into Hygieia configuration without requiring major changes to Hygieia itself. Perhaps @jayhogan can help here with assistance from others.

Third, we should figure out how this generator will be deployed and operated. Open to anyone who wants to help on this one.

For the first one, I'm envisioning a web survey/intuitive guide that prompts the user to answer certain questions about what they want Hygieia to help them manage (team, product, portfolio, pipelines, etc.) and uses their answers plus some code/automation to output 1) exact instructions/configurations for the user to make on external systems and 2) configuration file(s) that Hygieia can consume to make it work like the user expects it should work based on their answers. 

Open to feedback on any of this.
 ryanshriver
435093915 For the second and third threads I imagined something like a single docker image (could also be AMI) that contains the bare essentials, DB, api, UI and maybe audit-api. The first time the user goes to the UI in their browser they are redirected to a wizard which goes through the setup process asking the questions from your first thread. Based on the answers provided the generator would create properties files like we use today, download the appropriate collectors and start them using the generated properties files for configuration. Then it would use the remote dashboard api to create the corresponding dashboards. Finally it would set a flag denoting the installation is complete and subsequent visits to the UI would behave as usual. This could be built directly into the UI making it so that we don't have to do anything additional to deploy the generator.  matthewbeasley
465277527 After identifying and debating a few design options we’ve decided to go in this direction to implement an MVP that simplifies the initial setup of Hygieia. Target date is late March / early April to:

1. Automate the setup of a Hygieia environment in AWS using CloudFormation
2. Deploy Hygieia as a set of containers running on ECS (one each for UI, API and each collector)
3. Fetch Hygieia containers at deployment time from public Dockyard repo
4. User configuration choices including what collectors to run are passed as CloudFormation parameters at setup time

Notes:

1. At some point a GUI-based way for the user to select/configure the collectors is possible and we'd like to do it, but it would be hard to do with the current Hygieia architecture. Our proposed MVP solution doesn’t preclude this at some point later, but for MVP we decided against a GUI for now.

2. The solution is Docker-based so should be relatively portable, but for simplicity we chose to deploy this on AWS initially. We leverage the AWS ECS Fargate service for hosting the containers and the DocumentDB service for hosting the MongoDB so there are no virtual servers to maintain with the solution.

3. Based on internal testing, it takes about 12 minutes to provision and configure all AWS resources to run Hygieia. At that point the Admin can start building dashboards. This is very close to our 10 minute original goal (above) and perhaps as we implement we can streamline this slightly to get to under 10 minutes.

4. We make reasonable defaults to “wire together” the different Hygieia services without user’s having to specify every configuration. However, these can be overridden via CloudFormation parameters.


We’re in the process of implementing this solution and will create a PR with all proposed changes when done, ideally by late March / early April. More to come, feedback welcome. ryanshriver
434713371 I would say these are reasonable goals and options but the devil will be in the details. Honestly, I don’t think the deployment approach is the challenge and so any of the options mentioned above will likely work. To me, the challenge will be making the configuration of the individual components simple and easy. For example, each collector needs to be configured to point to the instance of whatever tool is being used (i.e. Jenkins, GitHub, etc..). In some cases, the external tool itself will need to be configured. For instance, it is better to use Github webhooks and the Jenkins Hygieia plugin than rely on the batch collection strategy. This feels like a huge barrier to getting started, especially if the person does not have administrative access to the tools or just doesn’t know the details to get the dashboard up and running.

I think we should take to heart the feedback provided in #2540. I'm sure the documentation is accurate and provides all of the relevant details needed to standup a Hygieia instance with any required collectors. However, can a person new to Hygieia consume all of this documentation and get a working version of Hygieia running in 10 minutes or less?

Here are some potential enhancements to @ryanshriver's proposal that could solve these challenges:

1. **Hygieia Installation Generator** - What if we created a web-based generator or CLI that guided a user through the installation and configuration process. The output would be a scaffolded installation that takes advantage of 1 or more of the design options mentioned above, with the configuration files populated based on the user's answers.
1. **Unified properties file** - I know it is not recommended to merge config files but this is a reasonable approach to reduce ""getting started"" overhead. We could provide a sample config file with as many reasonable defaults as possible and provide clear guidance in a getting started document. Hopefully we could limit the user changes to a single config file.

Thoughts? jayhogan

one more thing to add not sure why is this db getting generated automatically (dashboard).

 MilindDivre
434985502 Can you try doing http://localhost:8080/api/collector/type/scm

I am not sure about it being auto generated. 
Remove everything from your API properties and paste the following:
```

server.port=8080

When a field is changed to empty in the quality widget it was not able to be saved, as the associateCollectorToComponent function only updates based off of new values being passed, not values omitted. This fix checks to see if other values from the quality widget are being updated so that if a value is missing, it can be assumed that the previous value (if there was any) was deleted. 

**Caveat: this will not work if _all_ values from the widget are deleted from the configure page as there is no way to determine the widget type is there are no collector types in the request.

[],"Hi guys,

I'm wondering if it's possible publish more than one app per time with this plugin.
I know that I can use a pattern name (*.jar, *.war, *.java, ...) in the Artifact Name field, however I've not figured out any way to attribute different versions to them.

For example, let's assume that I have 2 files, core.jar and core-extension.jar. The first file version is 1.0.0 and the second one version is 2.0.1. I can set the Artifact Name to *.jar to deploy both files at once. However, Hygieia shows up that both .jar files versions are 1.0.0.

Is it possible set 1.0.0 to core.jar and 2.0.1 to core-extension.jar running the plugin only once?",373065164,2524,Hygieia publisher - jenkins plugin,2018-10-23 15:35:27,2019-01-30 04:47:49,closed,7,caiohcl,"432654291 Are you able to use a jenkinsfile for your job?  Sbrenthughes

- increments version to avoid overwriting issues",372699249,2523,Updated release.sh,2018-10-22 21:03:17,2018-10-23 14:41:35,closed,0,matthewbeasley,
[],"Hey,

I'm new to Hygieia and am trying to get Hygieia up and running and connect to our Github Enterprise using Docker Compose by following [the official documentation](http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/builddocker.html).  But have run into a few issues.

Step 1 & 2 went fine.

Step 3 I start having issues, firstly there's no container named `mongodb2`, but I figure they mean `hygieia_db_1`, so I exec into that instead with

```
docker exec -it hygieia_db_1 bash
```
However, when I try to execute the command it errors out saying it cannot connect to `192.168.64.2/admin`.  I figure since this _is_ the mongo container I can just use localhost, which instead gives me the error `User ""dashboarduser@dashboarddb"" already exists`.  Well, seems like this is done, cool?

Stop 4 brings up more problems.  Since, the example configuration in the documentation doesn't line up with the services in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.override.example.yml`, I assume it's outdated and instead go with the `override.example.yml` in the repo, but change the `github-collector:` as follows:

```yaml
  github-collector:
    environment:
    - GITHUB_HOST=<our enterprise ip>
    - GITHUB_CRON=0 * * * * *
    - GITHUB_COMMIT_THRESHOLD_DAYS=300
```

For Step 5 the restart seems to work.  The `docker port` command once again doesn't work because there's no container named `hygieia-ui` so I opt for the `hygieia_ui_1`.  And use that port to login via my browser.

I create a user then try to create an example dashboard with a `repo` widget to verify the github integration works.  But there's no option in the ""Select a type"" drop down.

![select-a-type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25732263/47313944-462c6180-d60e-11e8-9ef8-e1f62b3e9f1f.png)

438312657 @AaronNBrock Yes, do understand the problem and therefore suggested to configure the ""MONGODB_HOST"" environment property in the first place. Are you trying to run the ""github"" collector or the ""gitlab' collector. If it is the ""github"" collector, then you will have to add those properties under ""github-collector"" and not under ""gitlab-scm-collector"". On the docker-compose.yml ""gitlab-scm-collector"". is pointing to ""collectors/scm/gitlab"", thanks subodhbattina

433714228 Are you able to paste the logs from the github collector? Sbrenthughes
435096611 @AaronNBrock : Apologies, couldn't respond to you until now. Firstly, thanks for the step-by-step details that you provided. Yes, the documentation might need slight changes. 

But, to answer your question, the reason you are not seeing any options in the drop down menu on the UI is because the github collector has not run properly and registered in the database. 
 I looked at the Dockerfile and the ""properties-builder.sh"" files for the gihub-scm-collector (collectors/scm/github), and it might be that you are missing the following properties in your ""docker-compose-override.yml"". 

Can you please add these to your properties list under ""environment"", and try again?

1. **MONGODB_HOST**: Set it to ""localhost"" or the IP of the machine you are running the database on
2. **GITHUB_KEY**: 
This is the key value used to encrypt the user-id/password details or the personal access token of the private repos that you would register on the Code Repo Widget on Hygieia.
You will have to logon to the UI with an admin account to be able to generate this token.
Please check in the mongodb ""user_info"" collection  to see if there is an ""admin"" account available.
If not, I think you'll have to create one: Example of an admin account below:

{
    ""username"" : ""<admin user id>"", 
    ""authorities"" : [
        ""ROLE_USER"", 
        ""**ROLE_ADMIN**""
    ], 
    ""authType"" : ""STANDARD"", 
    ""firstName"" : """", 
    ""middleName"" : """", 
    ""lastName"" : """", 
    ""displayName"" : """", 
    ""emailAddress"" : """"
}

3. **PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**:
This access token key value would be used to connect to the github repo you register on the ui, if you haven't provided any user-id/password or access token on the widget. In which case, it would have to be a public repo accessible via this token that you provide.

Hope this helps, thanks battinasubodh
435113571 @Sbrenthughes Sorry, I missed your question [here are the logs](https://gist.github.com/AaronNBrock/ed4e9e40d7a7c7342145ef2714f3621f).

@battinasubodh I'm giving that a go, I'll let you know.
 AaronNBrock
435493156 @AaronNBrock : From the logs, it does seem like, its not connecting to the MongoDB, and the other two properties are also not set: github.key, and the github.personalAccessToken.

Please do set the list of environment properties I suggested earlier, thanks. battinasubodh
435941073 @battinasubodh okay, so, first things first before I deal with all the keys/access tokens, I'm trying to get the collector to connect to the mongodb server.

I've set my override file as follows:

```
  gitlab-scm-collector:
    environment:
    - GITHUB_HOST=<our github enterprise server>
    - GITHUB_CRON=0 * * * * *
    - GITHUB_COMMIT_THRESHOLD_DAYS=300
    - MONGODB_HOST=<ip of host>
```

However, this seems to have no effect on the github-collector, even after the changes the logs show:

```
#Database HostName - default is localhost
dbhost=10.0.1.1
```
and
```
github.host=github.com
```
Not what's specified in the override file.  I feel like I'm missing something here, do I need to specify the override file in the `docker-compose` command or something?

In order to integrate Hygieia with Jenkins you need to do some configurations.

http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/hygieia-jenkins-plugin.html

**Jenkins side**
1. Upload .hpi file from your ""Hygieia\hygieia-jenkins-plugin"" folder to Jenkins plugin section then you will be able to see the Hygieia Publisher in Job's Post Build action.
2. You need to set ""Hygieia Server URL"" in Global Hygieia Publisher Settings. For that Goto Manage Jenkins > configure system > Global Hygieia Publisher Settings

**Now in Hygieia side**
1. Set  application.properties ( I guess you already did) in your (\Hygieia\collectors\build\jenkins\target) folder.
2. Follow step from http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/jenkins.html to Run or Deploy Jenkins collector in separate cmd prompt.
Use cmd:
`java -jar [your-jenkins-build-collector].jar --spring.config.name=jenkins --spring.config.location=application.properties`

Make sure your MongoDB client and Hygieia API is running. To check if Hygieia API is running use http://localhost:8080/api/ping, it should return true in browser.

Hope it helps! yadurajshakti
431383398 @yadurajshakti - this is great information! Thank you for taking the time to help others. I do want to point out though that you don't need the jenkins plugin AND the jenkins collector. Both get you the same data so you just need to pick the one that suits you best. The jenkins plugin has better overall performance since it is push based as opposed to pull based like the collector. I would say the only time you should bother with the collector is if you are using a jenkins instance managed by someone else and you don't have the ability to install the plugin.  matthewbeasley
431593123 @matthewbeasley - Thank you so much!!! Now I have understood.

So yeah, We need to configure either **Jenkins side** (Push-based) OR **Hygieia side** (Pull-based) based on your need.

447211000 @matthewbeasley So i beleive either should use pull or push ? what will happen if we use both (jenkkins collector & jenkins publisher ) 
have installed jenkins collector & am able to pull all the data, but i want to publish code quality,security & some other reports to hygieia..in this case what would be the best option ?  RameshMuthuraj

I modified the ""collectors/build/jenkins/docker/Dockerfile"" to point the spring config to ""hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties"" and now container starts up without any issues.

This means that if you add `-e PROP_FILE /path/to/expected/properties` it will override that variable without need for modifying the dockerfile. Ideally though you should be using the jenkins plugin we provide as there are some performance issues for the jenkins build collectors on jenkins instances with a large number of jobs.  matthewbeasley
432668694 Thank you, Jenkins plugin is working fine.

I was following the ""https://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/builddocker.html"" to build and run docker image using maven and it failed so I still think it is a defect. (default config location is pointing to a test properties file instead of hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties) sbabutk
455353088 Agree with @sbabutk. Following the instructions on this site regarding creating and running the Docker Containers using docker-compose doesn't actually work and won't work for ANY of the collectors as they ALL have the same pattern of using application.properties rather than the name of what the actual properties files should be. I think it's worth correcting. Should just be a matter of changing the shall script use application.properties or modifying the Dockerfile to suit the collector. 

Other alternative is to modify the instructions so that people aren't caught scratching their heads on why it isn't working and having to debug this every single time.  daniel-ng

I've been trying to follow the Hygieia documentation @ https://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/setup.html for about a week before stumbling onto this page.

"
[],"Hi, 

I am trying to implement multiple same type widgets on a single dashboard. For example, having multiple GitLab repositories or multiple Jenkins builds in the same dashboard. 

Looking at the MongoDB and Java classes, I can see that each dashboard contains an application,  which contains an array of components.  A component then contains a map of CollectorType:ListOfCollectorItem, meaning that in theory, it can contain multiple Gitlab repos or Jenkins builds. Now it looks as if the current implementation should in theory allow multiple same type widgets, but that is not the case. I can see two ways of doing this. For example, let's say we want two GitLab repositories on the same dashboard: 

1) A dashboard contains an application, and this application contains two components. 
      Component A: has GitLab repo 1
      Component B: has GitLab repo 2
2) A dashboard contains an application, the application contains one component.
     Component A: has two GitLab repos 

Since I can't really wrap my head around this, could you explain why currently multiple same type widgets are not supported, and what is the limitation? Just FYI, I am not a front-end guy, so I haven't investigated the UI that much, maybe the limitation is on that side?

Thanks",367228540,2481,Multiple same type widgets on the same dashboard - what is the limitation?,2018-10-05 14:10:27,2018-11-27 21:39:56,open,18,dardanbekteshi,"431581064 @stevegal I made the first changes regarding the delete operation on a widget. You can see the changes here: https://github.com/dardanbekteshi/Hygieia/commit/ea31677c760ee2ed8904aeabe98e8006adaca3c2

I created a branch feature/multiple_widgets which is up to date with the original Hygieia master. I think that is the easiest way to collaborate. Please have a look at the change, maybe checkout the branch and add further changes. 

As it is now, the create and update operations will not work, and the problem I see is in the disable/enable field of a given collector item. Since when we update a given widget, that will mean that we need to disable the previous collector item which was ""holding its place"" in the component. And the reason for this is that whenever a widget is updated, a new collector item is created in the database, instead of updating the original one. IMO, this makes things more complicated, since as it is right now, we don't have a way to trace back and check which exact collector item is the old one. Because currently only one widget of a given type was supported, this was easy, and we could delete or disable all the collector items of a given type.

My guess is that there has to be a way to send some more information from the frontend to the back, like for example, send all the collector items of the component in a separate parameter, and then send the collector item we are interested in on a separate parameter. Right now, it looks like we are sending a List<CollectorItemId>, but from what I have seen, it is always only one collectoritemid (i.e. a singleton List).

But maybe we can further discuss once you have a look at the changes, and we can directly highlight snippets of code we think needs to be changed, might be easier :) 

And also, you can share your UI changes on another branch maybe, so I can also have a look and try to merge backend/frontend changes. dardanbekteshi

428538289 An answer I got on Gitter from @nireeshT, just in case someone else is interested into this question: 

> ""your 2nd option is feasible way for implementing multiple same type widget. Consider widget as collector_item in component. Component is dashboard"" dardanbekteshi
429916270 Hi @dardanbekteshi, I am looking for a solution for this as well. Do you think there is any backend code changes required? Or is it just UI changes?  HweeWong
429942621 Hi @HweeWong, I am not entirely sure, and that's why I raised this issue. But from what I have seen, changes are required in both backend and frontend.

I just read (#2495) that you have already done some UI changes, while I have done some research on the backend side. I have created the following diagram which consists of the mongoDB and Java code mapping.
 
![backend-diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23189173/46967014-92781e80-d0af-11e8-9849-5023bb8e29fa.png)

From what I see, the dashboard's Widget is connected to the component's CollectorItem. So, when someone deletes a widget, the backend needs to synchronize between these two classes, making sure that both the Dashboard and Component classes (and therefore the MongoDB collections) are updated. IMO, that's why the two repo widgets that you have created appear to be linked as they might point to the same CollectorItem! I am still not 100% sure, and I hope to have clarified this on Friday.

I think that we should join forces regarding this feature, where I can focus on the backend and you on the frontend? If you agree, then I suggest that you create a branch (e.g. multiple-widgets) and push the UI related code. I'll then have a look at it on Friday and start to make the backend changes accordingly. At the moment, I only work once a week on Hygieia since I am also involved in another project, but I think we can still have progress if we collaborate :)   dardanbekteshi
430034413 Doesn’t the config for a widget contain an array of collector items? The collector items are gathered at the backend and only linked through the widget config to the collector item... at least that’s what I thought when I recently did the log widget. And I too would appreciate multiple widgets! stevegal
430398453 From what I can see from looking at the `widgetConfigManager.js` and `widgetConfigManager.html` it adds/removes widgets based on widgetTitle. I reckon if you could change that and just expose an addWidget and removeWidget that checks for all widgets that start with the title and simply adds with a new title then it may work. Just not sure if the widget type is based on the title.. If so that'd have to change as well. stevegal
430406582 btw.. think this is the same as #2468 

Anyway... further investigations... I can get multiple widgets to add on the config screen quite easily, but as feared the dashboard view tries to create i think based on the title. But I can't see why this.. with a bit of tweaking.. wouldn't work. Maybe @matthewbeasley or @rvema have views? stevegal
431251296 Would love to have this feature available to us as soon as earliest. Thanks! divashdr
431289189 @dardanbekteshi For the extra widget, I have just duplicated the repo widget under UI components to see how it works - ideally we wouldn't want to do this manually.. I am not a frontend person as well. Thanks for posting the diagram, it does make it much clearer for me to understand what is going on.

Am I right saying that the widget is linked to a dashboard and application, hence not allowing us to show multiple widget?  (componentId : modalData.dashboard.application.components[0].id) HweeWong
431455606 Thanks, @dardanbekteshi for re-opening this issue!.  divashdr
431458457 it would seem that the widget.js also assumes the name is the type... I'm pretty certain if we took the type of widget through and removes the assumptions that that widget title and the name were the same it would work. stevegal
431465617 @divashdr it was not intentional, I closed it by mistake :) 

@stevegal I spent the day investigating the backend and all the methods that do the create/update/delete operations on both the Dashboard and Component classes (and the corresponding MongoDB collections). I think I found the problem, and it mostly lies in the DashboardServiceImpl class. In particular, the methods deleteWidget() and associateCollectorToComponent(). 
But now it is too late, so I will finish with the changes tomorrow morning and will share the code and my observations with you. Then hopefully the needed UI changes will be more clear for you to proceed with.

I am looking forward to collaborating and solving the issue together :D  dardanbekteshi
431466683 cool. I was thinking that if we changed the private List<String> activeWidgets; in DashboardRequest to be an object with the title and type we could get it to hold together stevegal
431569482 @dardanbekteshi yeah... upon making active widgets a List containing title and type, I've chased it bask to the same DashboardServiceImpl class. I can see that the component getCollectorItems is a Map<CollectorType,List<CollectorItems>>.. that would have to change to something that would allow more than one collector type. Just needs one more collection in between...

or maybe the delete just needs to be a bit more clever... collect the collectorids to remove... instead of the types... stevegal
431581064 @stevegal I made the first changes regarding the delete operation on a widget. You can see the changes here: https://github.com/dardanbekteshi/Hygieia/commit/ea31677c760ee2ed8904aeabe98e8006adaca3c2

When we turn TRACE on, we DO see the response for the projects come back but then right after that there is an exception. 

Now one strange thing we noticed was that the response (JSON), in the trace gets cut off at roughly 7,294 characters. Not sure if that is a trace limitation or some type of limit on how much data can be retrieved. (I would imagine the former).


So this is what we see

[],"Hello,

In our test environment we are running Hygieia's UI, API and mongodb container. I was able to link mongodb with API container and getting the response using url: `http://:/api/dashboard`"" as mentioned in the document.
For UI  i have spun an image which was present in the dockerhub and also linked it with the API container using ""docker run -itd -p 3000:80 --link hygieia-api_1 --name=hygieia-ui_1 hygieia-ui:latest /bin/bash"" command. But while accessing the UI from the browser im not getting the  ""api connected"" message as mentioned in the documents. 
Attaching the screenshot:

There's no ""api connected"" green tick in the UI page.

All the containers are in same network.

427872170 @mohit1606 the normal log will look something like this

However in your case it's :

I see the difference here as `""http://:port/""` i.e your UI is not pointing to the api perhaps somehow..

Can you try hitting these URLs in your browser and provide the result : 
`http://localhost:3000/api/appinfo`

`http://localhost:8080/api/appinfo`

and also can you please go to login page of your hygieia in chrome and open the developer console n send the screenshot like this :

429032322 @mohit1606 You are trying to use an old version of Hygieia UI. I would recommend using the latest deployed to master.  Please start here before doing anything else. Sbrenthughes
433713978 Please reopen if you didn’t solve this.  Sbrenthughes
427020648 @mohit1606 please don’t use our containers from dockerhub because they are out of date. Build the UI image on your local and run it that. Also I would recommend running “docker-compose up -d” from the root of your project in order to spin up the containers.  matthewbeasley
427024781 Thank you @matthewbeasley. I will try building our own own UI image.  mohit1606
427039010 I have used “docker-compose up -d” and it created UI, API and mongo containers for me. I can see logs and confirm that API and mongo containers are connected with each other. But still i am facing issue with the UI container. I couldn't see UI container getting linked with te API.
Do i need to make any changes in the UI container to make it talk with API container? mohit1606
427163520 @mohit1606 - it should be linked automatically. Will you run `docker ps` and paste the output here? matthewbeasley

i have tried running the below command as well to run the hygieia UI:

docker run -itd -p 3000:80 --link hygieia_api_1 --net hygieia_default --name=hygieia-ui_1 hygieia-ui:latest /bin/bash

447513221 Is this command line or IDE? My thought is the versions of powermock and mockito that mvn is using are incompatible.  

Which would not be the case if it were using the versions in the pom file  Sbrenthughes
447532954 Cli built from HEAD.  john-difool
427547051 @vmattos what version of java and mvn are you using? rvema
427939640 All my dependencies: 

java 
```
java version ""1.8.0_181""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)

```

We also built Hygieia on an ec2 running amazon linux, and it worked without any issues. It seems to be happening only on MacOs  vmattos
428412113 I have the same issue on Windows. Did you find a solution? bergeronjulien
428667740 @bergeronjulien  No solutions found yet 😢 
I have been using an ec2 running amazon linux to test hygieia

But now I need to automate the deploy and bootstrap of the app on our infra, and it would make my life easier if I could run it on my machine  vmattos
429510270 @vmattos  a temporary solution would be to skip the tests by modifying your command from `mvn clean install package` to `mvn clean install package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`

btw only `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true` should also work, package and install both are not required, install should suffice shardulsrivastava
441920734 is this still an issue? please reopen if this is still an issue rvema

one more question, i run the api using dashboard.properties. is it ok? and is there  any problem as im not run n configure audit-api? 

as fyi, i run those hygieia bhind corporate network. but i have successfully pull data for jenkins,sonar n jira.. nurhannankhairi
429361431 The audit-api is independent of the UI and API. It needs to be ran separately but for your case, right now, I wouldn't bother with it.

430153214 I can fetch the data from our internal host . thank you so much for your help. 
I remove gitlab.path from properties file and change apiversion to version 3 as we use API v3 at this moment.

btw, hygieia only provide the gitlab repo that commits for past 14days. if there is no commit within 14days, it will display no data. s0 I change my date on my laptop according to the commit date of gitlab repo. then it the graph is displayed.

426720589 `gitlab.path=/YMCA/Ytlc-Ymca.git` matches the repo you  are trying to collect from. I am not completely sure how gitlab works specifically but I am thinking this may not be the right path. Sbrenthughes
426865157 > `gitlab.path=/YMCA/Ytlc-Ymca.git` matches the repo you are trying to collect from. I am not completely sure how gitlab works specifically but I am thinking this may not be the right path.

the path is correct as the URL for Gitlab is: http://XX.XX.XX.XXX/YMCA/Ytlc-Ymca.git nurhannankhairi
427010962 After looking at the code, I don't believe the path is correct. If you look at the method `buildApiUrl` in https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/40b4242e2740b3b0bbc4aba4aaabb087e99dcbff/collectors/scm/gitlab/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/gitlab/GitlabUrlUtility.java, you will see that the path is used to construct the api url. 

Now I may be wrong but to me it doesn't make sense the the api url would be `http://XX.XX.XX.XXX/YMCA/Ytlc-Ymca.git/api/V4/Ytlc-Ymca/repository/commits/... etc`  Sbrenthughes
427315371 where to get the path Sir? nurhannankhairi
427712796 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26562484/46591173-8a3a4500-caeb-11e8-803f-417f8f2f7d89.png)
I can access the repo. nurhannankhairi
428184189 Have you tried no path? As in there may not be a path if your instance is `<my_instance>.com/YMCA/Ytlc-Ymca.git` Sbrenthughes
428410955 yes I have tried. and it still shows 401 unauthorized.  nurhannankhairi
429033967 Does `gitlab.key=` match your match the `key=` in your api properties? My only other thought is the `gitlab.apiToken=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` is invalid.

Is your repo private? Sbrenthughes
429062019 This is what I did to test and this works.

1) find a public repo with a master branch that has been updated within the last 14 days
2) configure widget to point to that repo
3) properties:

```
dbname=dashboarddb
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
#Collector schedule (required)
gitlab.cron=0/10 * * * * *

#Gitlab host (optional, defaults to 'gitlab.com')
gitlab.host=gitlab.com

#Gitlab protocol (optional, defaults to 'http')
gitlab.protocol=https

#Gitlab port (optional, defaults to protocol default port)
#gitlab.port=80

#Gitlab path (optional, if your instance of gitlab requires a path)
gitlab.path=

#If your instance of Gitlab is using a self-signed certificate, set to true, default is false
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false

#Gitlab API Token (required, user token the collector will use by default, can be overridden on a per repo basis from the UI. API token provided by Gitlab)
gitlab.apiToken=

#Maximum number of previous days from current date, when fetching commits
gitlab.commitThresholdDays=15

# Gitlab key for private repos
#gitlab.key=
```
 Sbrenthughes
429176386 yes my repo is private and i do have access as a master.

I test my private access token and it works. nurhannankhairi
429193067 but still hygieia cant access and it still the same error =401 unauthorized nurhannankhairi
429225016  I create gitlab.key in Hygieia ui, and also have put it in dashboard.properties file. the gitlab.apitoken i took from my gitlab credentials. when I run the gitlab on hygieia, i try many ways.. input apitoken,input the gitlab key..but nothing seems work. i also try to change path. i try with variety of path. also 401 unauthorized nurhannankhairi
429350211 You do not need a `path=` for you instance... Please leave it blank.

I created a private repo on gitlab.com and using the properties below I was able to pull data from it. 

What you should do first is try to pull from a public repo.. not using `gitlab.key` or `gitlab.apiToken`. If you cannot do this then there is another issue. If you can do this then I would try generating a new apiToken and trying that. 

```
dbname=dashboarddb

dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017


#Collector schedule (required)
gitlab.cron=0/10 * * * * *

#Gitlab port (optional, defaults to protocol default port)
#gitlab.port=80

#Gitlab path (optional, if your instance of gitlab requires a path)
gitlab.path=

#If your instance of Gitlab is using a self-signed certificate, set to true, default is false
gitlab.selfSignedCertificate=false

#Gitlab API Token (required, user token the collector will use by default, can be overridden on a per repo basis from the UI. API token provided by Gitlab)

429356574 Just create a public repo on your internal  Sbrenthughes

[],"# Overall concept
It is hard to create/configure and keep dashboard configurations up to date as more and more pipeline steps are added/removed/changed. This is a first attempt to auto-detect related events/pipeline steps etc to auto-complete dashboards, auto-update dashboards as things change. For now, this is intended to work with Jenkins pipeline, but can be extended to work with any pipeline. 

Given a dashboard configured with a code repository, as the corresponding Jenkins pipeline is executed, with the enhanced Jenkins Hygieia plugin, the dashboard will automatically be updated with Build and Sonar widget (out of the box). Enhanced plugin has open configuration to allow other events (such as Open Source scan, security scan, tests etc) to be captured and allow the corresponding collectors to auto-configure the dashboards. 

# High Level Design
Event Listener classes now correlate between collector items and automatically adds related collector items to existing dashboards. A new collection ""related_items"" is used for this. Event listeners (or any other collector or api) can write pairs of collector items  that potentially are related to ""related_items"" collection. A new listener to this collection finds dashboards matching with either of these pairs and adds the other one (if not already there) to those dashboards. 

For example: Start with a dashboard with a repo configured. The component document for that dashboard will have 1 collector item (for the repo). Now, a new build building the repo is saved to builds collection. Build Event listener will save the build collector item and the repo collector item to ""related_items"" collection. Related Items event listener then will find the dashboard that was configured with the repo collector item and will add the build collector item. For sonar, the relation is drawn via build id saved in the code_quality collection. 
 
# Changes (High Level)
- New collections: related_items, generic_collector_items
- New listener: RelatedItemsEventListener
- Modified listeners: BuildEventListener and CodeQualityEventListener
- New Core Models and Repositories: RelatedItems, GenericCollectorItems
- New APIs: To CRUD to the new collections
- Enhanced Hygieia plugin for Jenkins: New Global configuration allows to send ALL build and Sonar results directly to Hygieia without having to configure any individual job. Option is also available to publish ""raw"" collector item data to Hygieia for the collectors that are running. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6014941/46252158-e8539200-c432-11e8-87b7-2296dbfbb189.png)

Essentially it captures certain console log lines based on supplied regex for a given collector. Hygieia saves these ""raw"" data and the related build collector item id in a new collection ""generic_collector_items"". Corresponding collector can process/parse this raw data and find/create collector items as well save in the ""related_items"" collection. 

# More upcoming changes (Work in progress)
- All collectors will process the generic_collector_items collection and ""pick up"" its own set of data based on the collector name. 
- More standard tool integration in Jenkins plugin

I figured from the code that for environment ,it gets the artifacts to show on the products dashboard from the artifact table : 
Reference of the code : 
Class DynamicPipelineServiceImpl  
Flow: 
search() -> buildPipeline() -> processDeployments() -> 
```
   		if (env.getUnits() != null) {
    			for (DeployableUnit du : env.getUnits()) {
    				ArtifactIdentifier id = new ArtifactIdentifier(null, du.getName(), du.getVersion(),null, null);
    				
    				Collection<BinaryArtifact> tmp = artifacts.get(id);
    				if (tmp != null && !tmp.isEmpty()) {
    					artifact = tmp.iterator().next();
    					deployableUnit = du;
    					break;
    				}
    			}
    		}
```


here product view gets the artifacts from the artifacts collection and if we are not using any artifacts collector ( my case) then this will be empty.

hence data in  COMMIT,BUILD,DEV should be in mins.
Any idea where can i look in the code for the issue.

As i can see that these details are being calculated from the timestamps with respect to the stages

these timestamps are being calculated for each commit after getting the deployable units for every environment of the component : 
getEnvironments -> deployService.getDeployStatus -> getDeployStatus() -> Deployable Units are added from environment_component and environment_status tables.

Now assuming that there is only one deployment collector then there will be only one deployable unit for every environment of a component, that too will be the latest deployment i.e deployable unit.

now is it correct to calculate the stage timestamps based on the latest deployment , rather than calculating it based on the deployments for that commit.

1) Started local instance of the Hygieia audit API 
2) add the test url to the monitor Widget ex. `http://localhost:8090/apiaudit/ping`
3) Waited for Check to go Green
4) Stopped local instance of the Hygieia audit API

We have two scenarios mentioned below:

1. We are using Hygieia plugin 1.2 in few of jenkins instances. In the pipeline view of Hygieia for the deploy jobs we are getting the data like:

                                   ENV1                               ENV2

Means the environment name in the column and the package deployed in them below that. 

2. But for the other jenkins instances we are using the plugin version 1.3 and the result in the pipeline view is like:

                                            ENV1                                                               ENV2

That means environment name but below instead of deployed package it is only displaying the time.

Encryption now works; however, the github personal access token doesn't work when specified in the properties file. When I specify the github personal access token in the UI the collector pulls the github data.  marchenm
429356196 @marchenm 
When you specify the github personal access token in the UI, it gets stored in the database with the repo details, and collector is able to pull that out from the database.

Again, are you able to cat and see your properties file for the collector that the Dockerfile makes, can you please share that.
Just to debug, make the properties file at a location you are able to access it, before copying it into your image context folder, and then share the file please.
We want to make sure the property ""github.personalAccessToken"" is having the token value on the properties file.

The other thing is please share the logs or error you are seeing around the github access issues, it could be a proxy issue interfering with the request. Thanks. subodhbattina

435564772 @subodhbattina I don't thing that you understood @marchenm  issue/finding.

puting PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the properties files doesn't change anything, you have to do it fron the UI to get it to work. in this is due to : (DefaultGithubClient.java) 
`        String personalAccessToken = (String) repo.getOptions().get(""personalAccessToken"");
        String decryptedPersonalAccessToken = decryptString(personalAccessToken, settings.getKey());`
where repo is fetched from db pushed by API/UI, so the documentation is misleading and need to be updated.

428221160 I'm still having the issue. Is there any documentation on how to set up encryption with the docker containers?  marchenm
428234080 @marchenm: I think the question is, within your Dockerfile for the collector, how are you setting the properties that the collector expects. Ensure you are setting the KEY value on the properties file that the collector expects. 
Simple way of doing this would be to have your collector properties file with all the properties set, and then copy that properties file over in your Dockerfile for the image, and then start your container.
Example: 
```VOLUME /var/app/config
COPY ${JAR_FILE} /var/app/<collector jar file>
ENTRYPOINT [""java"",""-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom"",""-jar"",""/var/app/collector jar file""]
CMD [ ""--spring.config.location=/var/app/config/application.properties"" ]```

""JAR_FILE"" points to your collector jar in your compose file. subodhbattina
428240336 This is an example for the github collector properties file below:

```dbname=<dbname>
dbreplicaset=false
dbhostport=<dbhost>:<port>
dbusername=<dbusername>
dbpassword=<dbpassword>
github.cron=0 0/1 * * * *
github.host=github.com

# Maximum number of previous days from current date, when fetching commits
github.commitThresholdDays=15

# Optional: Error threshold count after which collector stops collecting for a collector item. Default is 2.
github.errorThreshold=1

github.key=<key used for encryption/decryption>

# Personal access token generated from github and used for making authenticated calls
github.personalAccessToken=<personal Access Token> subodhbattina
428302429 After regenerating the apikey in the ui and adding it to the `docker-compose.override.yml` I was able to get encryption working by re-entering my github personal access token in the configuration ui. Why isn't it picking up the tocken from the properties file? 
https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia/blob/b9fd1dfc5bd823a14c925073ee5f38037b5e6d74/collectors/scm/github/docker/properties-builder.sh#L33 marchenm
428610274 @marchenm Firstly, just so i understand what you are saying: The ""apiKey"" and ""personalAccessToken"" are two different things:
1. ""apiKey"" is used purely for encryption and decryption
2. ""personalAccessToken"" is used for accessing the github api's.

That said: The docker compose file that you posted shows this below:
- KEY=tVT3AXZwufLmN/3+FfLNTLbmyMFK3+zW
- PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN= </github token/>

Where as ""properties-builder.sh"" shows this below:

```#This is the key generated using the Encryption class in core
github.key=${GITHUB_KEY}
#personal access token generated from github and used for making authentiated calls
github.personalAccessToken=${PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}```

I hope you are reading the ""apiKey"" as ""github.key=${KEY}"".
Just wanted to point this out incase this is causing any failures .
This is right above where you set the ""github.personalAccessToken"" in the ""properties-builder.sh"".

That said:
Are you able to cat and share the properties file?
Also, could you please share your Dockerfile? Thanks. subodhbattina
428976164 @marchenm : Do you have any updates on this? thanks. subodhbattina
429176241 Right, I understand the difference. I set GITHUB_KEY is set to the apiKey that was generated in the ui.

After deploying the containers and generating the key in the ui I set it  in the `docker-compose.override.yml` as environment variables for the api container and the github collector. 
```
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    environment: # for a full list check the corresponding properties-builder file
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE={{ db_name }}
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=db
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT=27017
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_USERNAME={{ db_user }}
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD={{ db_pass }}
      - KEY={{ github_apiKey }}
      - AUTH_SECRET={{ hygieia_auth_key }}
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/hygieia/logs

  github-collector:
    environment:
      - HYGIEIA_API_ENV_SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_USERNAME={{ db_user }}
      - HYGIEIA_API_ENV_SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD={{ db_pass }}
      - HYGIEIA_API_ENV_SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE={{ db_name }}
      - MONGO_PORT=tcp://db:27017
      - MONGODB_HOST=db
      - MONGODB_PORT=27017
      - GITHUB_ERROR_THRESHOLD=25
      - GITHUB_KEY={{ hygieia_encrypt_key }}
      - GITHUB_HOST=https://github.com
      - GITHUB_CRON=0 * * * * *
      - GITHUB_COMMIT_THRESHOLD_DAYS=300
      - PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN={{ github_access_token }}
      - GITHUB_KEY={{ github_apiKey }}
```

Encryption now works; however, the github personal access token doesn't work when specified in the properties file. When I specify the github personal access token in the UI the collector pulls the github data.  marchenm
429356196 @marchenm 
When you specify the github personal access token in the UI, it gets stored in the database with the repo details, and collector is able to pull that out from the database.

Again, are you able to cat and see your properties file for the collector that the Dockerfile makes, can you please share that.
Just to debug, make the properties file at a location you are able to access it, before copying it into your image context folder, and then share the file please.
We want to make sure the property ""github.personalAccessToken"" is having the token value on the properties file.

The other thing is please share the logs or error you are seeing around the github access issues, it could be a proxy issue interfering with the request. Thanks. subodhbattina
431382175 @marchenm: If you dont have any updates on this, will go ahead and close the issue, thanks subodhbattina
432677936 @marchenm: Since I didn't see any updates, assuming this is resolved at your end. Closing the issue, thanks subodhbattina
435564772 @subodhbattina I don't thing that you understood @marchenm  issue/finding.

puting PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the properties files doesn't change anything, you have to do it fron the UI to get it to work. in this is due to : (DefaultGithubClient.java) 
`        String personalAccessToken = (String) repo.getOptions().get(""personalAccessToken"");
        String decryptedPersonalAccessToken = decryptString(personalAccessToken, settings.getKey());`
where repo is fetched from db pushed by API/UI, so the documentation is misleading and need to be updated.

1. Define an Access Token using the VersionOne UI: Go to Configuration - Applications and add a new Application with name Hygieia. 
Note: Person should have “Sys Admin” privileges to create the application.

2. After new application added, it will be listed under ‘select an application’ in Applications page, then generate public token to that application (In below page).
Navigation to open Applications page: Click on profile symbol at Top right corner  and select ‘Application’ and generate token.

[],"Hey guys,

I've been unsuccessfully trying to add a Jira widget into my dashboard through hygieia api. I figured out how add build, code analysis and bitbucket widgets so far but Jira I didn't.

Following the data I've been using:
`  ""featureEntries"": [
  	{
    	""description"": ""<projectName>"",
        ""options"": {
            ""teamName"": ""<teamName>"",

            ""projectId"": <projectId>
        }, 
        ""toolName"": ""Jira""
	}

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Hygieia. subodhbattina
442248680 Hey guys, I forgot to change a file. I did it, and it's working now.
@divashdr and @subodhbattina, I really appreciate your help guys!! caiohcl
443007284 @caiohcl You are Welcome !
@divashdr and @caiohcl , Thanks for reaching out and your interest, and for your patience. subodhbattina
421385275 @caiohcl Please share what error you are getting? Also, This is a sample of the ""featureEntries""

```{
    ""featureEntries"": [ 
        { 
            ""description"": ""<projectName>"", 
            ""options"" : { 
                ""featureTool"" : ""Jira"", 
                ""teamName"" : ""<teamName>"", 
                ""teamId"" : ""<teamId>"", 
                ""projectName"" : ""<projectName>"", 
                ""projectId"" : ""<projectId>"", 
                ""showStatus"" : {
                    ""kanban"" : true, 
                    ""scrum"" : false
                }, 
                ""estimateMetricType"" : ""storypoints"", 
                ""sprintType"" : ""scrumkanban"", 
                ""listType"" : ""epics""
            }, 
            ""toolName"": ""Jira"" 
        } 
    ]
}

Here are the potential values for the below properties

""estimateMetricType"" : ""storypoints"" or  ""count"" or ""hours""
""listType"" : ""epics"" or ""issues""
""sprintType"" : ""scrum"" or ""kanban"" or ""scrumkanban""
``` subodhbattina
421415991 Hi @subodhbattina , thanks for the replay.

Actually, Hygieia doesn't pop up any error message. Instead, the widget isn't set up when I call the API. It keeps like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2295899/45563372-c0e5ae00-b812-11e8-96df-810e9cc0dfd9.png)

The weird thing is that I've been successfully set up the others widget... I've got this issue only with Jira Widget.... caiohcl
422057682 Hi @caiohcl Sure, Np. Just to get some clarification, were you able to use the ""featureEntries"" format I shared earlier, are you still seeing this behavior with that format? Please share the exact message you have used on the call to the API. Thanks ! subodhbattina
422062109 Hi @subodhbattina 
Sure. I've been using the following code:
```
  ""featureEntries"": [
  	{
    	""description"": ""<ProjectName>"",
        ""options"": {
            ""teamName"": ""<ProjectTeam>"",
            ""featureTool"": ""Jira"",
            ""projectName"": ""<ProjectName>"",
            ""projectId"": ""<ProjectId>"",
            ""teamId"": ""<TeamId>"",
            ""showStatus"" : {
            	""kanban"" : true, 
                 ""scrum"" : false
            },
            ""estimateMetricType"" : ""storypoints"", 
            ""sprintType"" : ""scrumkanban"", 
            ""listType"" : ""epics""
        },
        ""pushed"": false,
        ""toolName"": ""Jira""
	}
  ], 
``` caiohcl
422423621 @caiohcl:
Lets do a few check here to see if the widget is created in the dashboard:
1. Pull up your hygieia dashbaord:
In the browser developer console: Look for the URL as below:

**_https://<host_name>/api/dashboard/<dashboard_id>_**

2. Make a note of the ID in the above url, go to your MongoDB dashbaord, and run the below query on the ""dashboards"" collection:

**Sample Query: {_id : ObjectId(""<dashboard_id>"")}**

3. Please check if you have widgets such as this in the document that pulls up:

**""widgets"" : [
        {
            ""_id"" :  ObjectId(""<dashboard_id>"")
            ""name"" : ""feature"", 
            ""componentId"" : ObjectId(<component_id value>), 
            ""options"" : {
                ""id"" : ""feature0"", 
                ""featureTool"" : ""Jira"", 
                ""teamName"" : ""<Team Name>"", 
                ""teamId"" : ""<team_id>"", 
                ""projectName"" : ""<project_name>"", 
                ""projectId"" : ""<project_id>"", 
                ""showStatus"" : {
                    ""kanban"" : true or false, 
                    ""scrum"" : true or false
                }, 
                ""estimateMetricType"" : ""storypoints"", 
                ""sprintType"" : ""scrumkanban"", 
                ""listType"" : ""epics""
            }
        }
    ]**

4. Please make a note of the ""projectId"" and the ""teamId"" from the document above from MongoDB.

5. And then, in your mongo db, in the ""feature"" collection, see what data you have for that teamId and projectId

**Sample Query: { ""sProjectID"": ""<projectId>"", $and: [ { ""sTeamID"": ""<teamId>"" } ] }**

422424662 @caiohcl : If you are not seeing the data in MongoDB, please share the API logs from when added the Jira widget. We wont to see if there were any error or exceptions at all in the api when you tried to add the widget. Thanks subodhbattina
422832777 @caiohcl: Following up to check if you have any updates on this at all? Thanks subodhbattina
422883596 Hi @subodhbattina... I'm out of office until Friday. I'll get back to you when I get the information. Thanks for your help. caiohcl
423210360 @caiohcl: Sounds Good. Thanks ! subodhbattina
423594459 Hi @subodhbattina 
I checked API and JIRA logs, and there's no exception or error message. Also, there's no data regarding JIRA widget into the database.

424782723 @caiohcl Thanks for bringing this to our notice, we'll work on fixing this and get back to you. Thanks ! subodhbattina
425471228 @subodhbattina, no problem.
Do you have any idea of how long is this fix gonna take to be deployed on master? 
Also, let me know if you need help. caiohcl
429404465 Hey guys.. any update regarding the fix of this issue?  Thanks!!! caiohcl
431257128 @caiohcl 
It worked for me 

To make it work, the below code changes are required

The sample request payload for Jira widget worked as part of the **/api/dashboard/remoteCreate** or
**/api/dashboard/remoteUpdate** api calls

 ""featureEntries"":[
      {

         ""toolName"":""Jira"",
         ""description"":""Metrics Service Team(MST)"",
         ""pushed"":false,
         ""options"":{
            ""teamName"":""MST"",
            ""featureTool"":""Jira"",
             ""projectName"" : ""Metrics Service Team(MST)"",
             ""projectId"" : ""15258144130"",
             ""teamId"" : ""15258144034"",
             ""estimateMetricType"":""count"",
             ""listType"":""issues"",
              ""showStatus"" : {
                    ""kanban"" : false,
                    ""scrum"" : true
                }
         }
      }
   ],

You have to make the below two code changes to the 

1) **DashboardRemoteRequest.java**
Replace the following inner class 

**FROM**
 public static class FeatureEntry extends Entry {

        @Override
        public CollectorType getType() {
            return CollectorType.AgileTool;
        }

        @Override
        public String getWidgetId() {
            return ""feature0"";
        }

        @Override
        public String getWidgetName() {
            return ""feature"";
        }

        **@Override
        public Map<String, Object> toWidgetOptions() {
            return null;
        }**
    }

**TO**
 public static class FeatureEntry extends Entry {

        @Override
        public CollectorType getType() {
            return CollectorType.AgileTool;
        }

        @Override
        public String getWidgetId() {
            return ""feature0"";
        }

        @Override
        public String getWidgetName() {
            return ""feature"";
        }

        @Override
        public Map<String, Object> toWidgetOptions() {
    			Map<String, Object> opts = new HashMap<>();
    			opts.put(""id"", getWidgetId());
    			 for (String key : options.keySet()) {
    	                opts.put(key, options.get(key));
    	         }
    			return opts;

    		}

    }

2) Add the ""featureEntries"" to the getAllEntries() method and try the dashboard create API from postman first to see the difference. I have my Jira widget get created as expected with the collected data. Thanks
 public List<Entry> getAllEntries() {
        List<Entry> all = new ArrayList<>();
        all.addAll(buildEntries);
        all.addAll(featureEntries);
        all.addAll(codeRepoEntries);
        all.addAll(staticCodeEntries);
        all.addAll(libraryScanEntries);
        all.addAll(securityScanEntries);
        all.addAll(functionalTestEntries);
        all.addAll(deploymentEntries);
        return all;
    }

441327517 Hey guys,
Sorry for the late reply. I've been testing the changes proposed by @divashdr, however I'm still not able to remotely create this widget. 
I had changed the code, rebuilt API, rebuilt core, rebuilt the container... but I'm getting an error message that states ""Jira collector does not support field: teamName"". 
I used the same call as @divashdr shared with us btw.
Any ideas? 
 caiohcl

[],"Hey!!

I've been working on automate the creation of team dashboards through Hygieia API, calling the POST /dashboard/remoteCreate API.
I can successfully run and create the team dashboard on swagger. However, when I run the same curl code on my cmd, I get the following unauthorized message:

> ""status"":401,""error"":""Unauthorized"",""message"":""Full authentication is required to access this resource"",""path"":""/api/dashboard/remoteCreate""

The curl command is the following:

`curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{
  ""metaData"": {
    ""applicationName"": ""String new application"",
    ""componentName"": ""String new application"",

    ""title"": ""dash new application"",
    ""type"": ""team""
  }
}' 'http://localhost:9080/api/dashboard/remoteCreate?api_key=$apiKey'`

Log in as admin, then go your admin settings. Then click Generate API tokens > New. Enter the username you want to use then set your expiration date to an acceptable future date, click Create. Write you token down as you will not be able to see it again. Now take that token and insert it into this command: `echo 'PasswordIsAuthToken:{""apiKey"":""<api-token-you-created>""} | base64`. Save the output.

Now when you issue create dashboard requests you need to set two headers. `apiUser` and `Authorization`. `apiUser` value is the user you create and `Authorization` value will be `apiToken <base64 encoded result>`. matthewbeasley
