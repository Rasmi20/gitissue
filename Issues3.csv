  <!-- profiles
   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
   | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
   |
   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
   |
   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,
   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
   | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
   |
   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
   |       variables for plugins in the POM.
   |
   |-->
  <profiles>
    <!-- profile
     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
     |
     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
     | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
     |
     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
    <profile>

369365880 @nireeshT yes, the configure screen currently just enables scoring for the dashboard by clicking on Save button.
I think adding some explanatory text might help ""Click on save to enable scoring for your dashboard"". If you have any ideas let me know, will fix it. thanks

We had a way to configure scoring using custom Or default configuration.
The default was picked up from configuration in scoring collector, and custom from configure screen.
We removed custom option from configure screen, as while comparing dashboard scores default configurations made configs same for all.
I did check-in the custom-config html file we had, but its not referenced in config.html : https://github.com/walmartlabs/Hygieia/blob/0c021beb2f9651de12aa38b3040a0f0e8a93fecd/UI/src/components/widgets/score/custom-config.html sidbha007
369370757 @sidbha007  - yep, got it. Scoring makes more sense when it is configured at the instance level. Just a thought, can we have score widget as view only on dashboard and enable widget on Administer dashboard modal by creating a new tab ""Settings"" -> Score (checkbox) on/off. 
<img width=""862"" alt=""screen shot 2018-02-28 at 3 16 26 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22962180/36811049-89d02c74-1c9a-11e8-9ebe-8048c5307909.png"">

Also can we persist all scoring properties into Mongo via JSON  when ever collector starts and read the criteria from Mongo to calculate score. You have to setup rules in json and read through them to calculate metrics. Check out these files. 

https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/test-data/cicd-gates.json

 nireeshT
369377344 @nireeshT having it enabled in administer dashboards sounds like a good idea. Thanks, will look into changing to this.

For your second point, I am not sure if I fully understand it.
Are you suggesting that scoring configuration is persisted in mongo, and score is calculated on UI based on the config? Like, we fetch the config and use the data in the dashboard to calculate score. If you can explain more, it would help. Thanks. I'll also look at cicd gates

In current implementation, score is calculated and persisted for each dashboard and available via apis for each dashboard
- The score apis for dashboard can be used in other places like Product dashboard, and we have internal team dashboards where the scoring is displayed. So, it doesn't rely on dependent data used to calculate score
- The time range could be flexible, e.g we can use 30 days instead of 14 days to calculate score without changing in UI sidbha007
369653719 @sidbha007  Yes, if you could store the config in Mongo and read it from there to calculate score. I understand once the score is calculated for all dashboards, it is persisted into ""score_metric"".  How about an objectId for scoreWidgetMetrics instead of widgetName here, because it solved future compatibility if we enable multiple same type widgets in a dashboard. That could mean multiple ""build"" widgets in dashboard and it will be consistent with data model. 
<img width=""956"" alt=""screen shot 2018-03-01 at 11 40 44 am"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22962180/36857042-82e847c4-1d45-11e8-8bb5-b8bf5e62e362.png"">
 nireeshT
369975429 @nireeshT thank you for reviewing 👍 
Cool, so you are suggesting to have widget id in scoreWidgetMetrics instead of name.
So, reason had kept id as widget name, as was thinking the score type could be for Dashboard, Team & User in future. With ids as ""build, deploy, quality, scm"", it works for any type. But, having widget id might be good for dashboard. Am, looking at it on how to change it to have widget.

So, for the other point to calculate scores by persisting in mongo, are you thinking something like this
- Collector starts and persists configuration 
- The same configuration is used to calculate score for dashboards in collector
- have a api to view configuration
So, by saving configuration we can read it from mongo using a api, instead of looking at config file. Just wanted to be clear, if thats the intent. 
will look at these, thanks sidbha007
370015470 @sidbha007  - yep, that is what I thought of persisting config into Mongo.  nireeshT
370851401 @nireeshT i have added few changes, if you could have a look. thanks
- Score metrics has field refId which will have widget id. In UI, refId is used to attach score for a widget
- Scoring settings are now saved in collection `score_criteria_settings` and used to calculate score + API to access it
https://github.com/walmartlabs/Hygieia/blob/cd9133d7ae2d28e976ecaf4407361c370ff5ab31/api/src/test/resources/score-criteria-settings.json

When I remove score widget from Capone template, I don't see individual widget scores. Anyways, these changes are rough draft though. If you see an option of moving the toggle to enable score to Administer- dashboard screen, this kind of display is possible and can get rid of score widget. BTW, on click of info icon will display scoreComponentDetails. Let me know your thoughts.

 nireeshT
371189140 @nireeshT  I thought about it, IMO score as a widget has its advantages in usability
It follows conventions of other widgets which makes it easy to answer some questions
- What is this widget for ->  Score (the header says it)
- When was it last updated -> DateTime in upper right
- How to see details -> ""View Details"" link is little more obvious
- it could be activated/deactivated
The score itself stands out as it has big size, with text for the score say ""3.5"". It grabs attention
It is little easier to relate that the other widgets that show ""star rating"" are for the score.

The disadvantage is the cost of space it takes on UI.

I was thinking about the idea to put it besides title.
In the dashboard page, the header has a bit of 
- Primary navigation (Hygieia Icon)
- Secondary Navigation (Widget, Pipeline, Cloud) links
- Title of Dashboard
Putting score beside the title makes it bit restrictive in horizontal space. we could only put this much
It is difficult to add text ""score"" or add few other details. 
Comparatively, it makes a bit harder to figure out.

I thought about moving title on the page with score and tabs.
Please check this.

It follows the same conventions and might be little easier to understand but with same space problems, and not as clean when its shown in a widget.

Another option could be to reduce space used by score widget.
<img width=""1404"" alt=""scoreinwidget"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5722038/37102928-f10fe24a-2220-11e8-80f0-9caec1fe6b9e.png"">

I do think it does look cleaner in the widget.
But, I might be biased with the score in a widget as we have used it for a while internally and it has worked. sidbha007
371209415 @sidbha007  - I like both the options but I am some how inclined to first option. Reason being user can create a dashboard with variety of templates. Infact they can create a custom template. If we put the score widget in the existing standard template (Capone.html), they could have a score widget which they might not need on dashboard and there is no way to hide it. I am thinking if we could bring out both the flavors to ground.  With the first option, if you could keep everything intact on header (Hygieia logo, dashboard -title and Widget, Pipeline, Cloud tabs) , use the space where you added title to display - ""
<img width=""180"" alt=""screen shot 2018-03-02 at 1 31 00 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22962180/37106549-1593eb46-2200-11e8-8441-4b62b6177319.png"">
Dashboard Score i - ""score value
 ng-rateit(your version of stars) "". This could be enabled/disabled with toggle from administer dashboard. Also I like the idea of last updated next to score.


With the widget option, we can have a separate standard template - score**Template.html and you can add score widget in the layout. This way we can keep the existing templates intact and can have both the options.

[],"I've recently run into issues when using [this plugin](https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin) to generate our images. This PR makes it so that you no longer need to use this plugin in order to generate images. This makes our approach more flexible as users now have a choice for how to build images. I think in the future we should deprecate the use of docker-maven-plugin in favor of [dockerfile-maven](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven).

Grievances against docker-maven-plugin:
- Builds stopped working randomly. Not sure exactly when this broke. I noticed this when trying to build images using a jenkins job. At first I thought it was a proxy issue until I deleted my local maven repository and the build started failing on my local as well.
- Requires external dependencies: Not only do we depend on the plugin for builds but the plugin itself has open source dependencies. This introduces unnecessary complication in an enterprise setting that seeks to reduce the risk of pulling in open source libraries. 
- This plugin does certain things behind the scenes. This means that the Dockerfile it uses isn't the only thing you have to worry about since in the background it copies files and stuff like that. This makes our Docker setup unusual and therefore more difficult to understand. We also give up a little bit of control for the sake of convenience and in my experience it's not that convenient. 
- This plugin is deprecated. Spotify themselves have stopped using it. You can read more about it on the [github page](https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin).

PR Contents:
- Add a Dockerfile to the root of every component (ui, api, api-audit, collectors). This let's you run `docker build .` in that directory and get an image.
- Add build directives for all services in docker-compose.yml. This allows you to run `docker-compose build` and have all images created at once.
- Change all the `x-properties-builder.sh` files to just `properties-builder.sh`. This makes it so that our Dockerfiles are more consistent. Also the prefixes weren't really adding to the readability since the file exists in the context of a directory therefore you already know what properties-builder you are dealing with.
- Add env PROP_FILE. This makes it so that the build can specify where the property file is located. The `properties-builder.sh` scripts now all use $PROP_FILE to know where to put the property file. This allows you to set the location of the properties file in one place and it's baked into the image itself. 
- Removed lines from the `properties-builder.sh` files that override $PROP_FILE. It's not clear what those were meant to accomplish and it's much cleaner to handle that in the Dockerfiles.

The Horizon:
- Use [dockerfile-maven](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven) to integrate image creation into the maven lifecycle. 
- Deprecate the use of [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin).
 
Here's a screenshot of the failure of fresh builds. To trigger this you'll need to delete your ~/.m2/repository folder (scary, I know)

I've not looked at this for a while.

I'm planning to implement Hygieia in an upcoming sprint. The first task is
get it working in OpenShift. I'll share the work with the Hygieia community.

I'll keep you posted.

385002545 @yodaqua - I am going to close this as it has more than likely been solved. Feel free to open another issue if you have problems matthewbeasley
366341693 @yodaqua - I too have had issues with that plugin recently. I just submitted a [PR](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/2039) to remove the plugin as a requirement for image creation. 

In your case though it seems as if you haven't yet run `mvn clean install`. Is this the case? If so run that command and try again. The Docker build requires that the project be compiled first using maven. matthewbeasley
366341976 @yodaqua - also thank you for the details of your environment! matthewbeasley
366493542 @matthewbeasley thanks for getting back to me.

I should've mentioned that I did run mvn clean install package before mvn docker:build which resulted in the error.

However afterwards I experimented:
1. Deleted my .m2 dir
2. Ran mvn docker:build

This resulted in the initial error.

This mornings events:

- As requested I've run  mvn clean install and then mvn docker:build which resulted in the initial error.
- However about a minute afterwards I ran mvn docker:build -X which resulted in a different error (same error, different docker build). Summary below. The full output is attached ([mvn docker-build -X.txt](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/files/1734429/mvn.docker-build.-X.txt))

384607566 Hi Matthew

I've not looked at this for a while.

I'm planning to implement Hygieia in an upcoming sprint. The first task is
get it working in OpenShift. I'll share the work with the Hygieia community.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks

Don

I did this to try and get it working. After opening bash shell on the jenkins collector docker image:
```
cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer /docker-java-home/jre/lib/security/
cd /docker-java-home/jre/lib/security/

cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.pem /etc/ssl/certs
cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer /etc/ssl/certs
cd /etc/ssl/certs
update-ca-certificates

cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.pem /etc/ca-certificates/update.d
cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer /etc/ca-certificates/update.d
cd /etc/ca-certificates/update.d

cp /hygieia/logs/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
update-ca-certificates
```

If I look at the error it is a Java Keystore issue. But the collector is not using the CA certificate somehow? Any help on this would be great.",297391539,2032,Jenkins build collector Root Certificate challenge,2018-02-15 10:16:25,2018-09-18 14:40:10,closed,3,pversteijnen,,"365930286 @pversteijnen Interesting. Can you try this on a non-docker jenkins collector. Alternately, check the java home(s) in your docker setup. Perhaps the collector is using a different jdk / jre than the one you are importing the cert into. satishc1
365958909 @satishc1 I have checked the Java_Home
```
root@2ba5ef71ef07:/hygieia# echo $JAVA_HOME
/docker-java-home/jre
```
Imported the certificate again:
```
root@2ba5ef71ef07:/docker-java-home/jre/lib/security# keytool -import -alias rootcarwe -trustcacerts -file /hygieia/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer -keystore jks-keystore -storepass changeit -noprompt
keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Certificate not imported, alias <rootcarwe> already exists
root@2ba5ef71ef07:/docker-java-home/jre/lib/security# keytool -import -alias rootcarwe -trustcacerts -file /hygieia/RootCertificate_RWE_base64.cer -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Certificate not imported, alias <rootcarwe> already exists
```
No change and still the certificate error. Not familier with Java and I have the Docker setup so starting the collector without Docker is a challenge. But looking back at all the issues I have getting Hygieia up and running is nog giving me much confidence for the future.

Could be that I'm doing something wrong with the certificate? If I view the certificate path there are two certificates above the site certificate. I only import the highest level. Should I import both? pversteijnen
366983890 Solved it by creating my own docker image based on the hygieia source code. Added the certificates to a folder in the source tree and copy them to the container using the Dockerfile

```
FROM docker.io/openjdk:8-jre

MAINTAINER Hygieia@capitalone.com

RUN mkdir /hygieia /hygieia/config

COPY *.jar /hygieia/

        openssl x509 -outform der -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/$cert -out $cert.der; \
        keytool -import -alias $cert -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -trustcacerts -file $cert.der -storepass changeit -noprompt; \
        rm $cert.der; \
    done

WORKDIR /hygieia/

CMD ./jenkins-build-properties-builder.sh && \
  java -jar jenkins-build-collector*.jar --spring.config.location=/hygieia/config/hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties
```

Big difference is that the certificates are changed to a der format. I think did was what I missed. pversteijnen

[],"I have installed the hygieia jenkins plugin using .hpi file, and in the jenkins configuration, i have provided the api url and did the test connection, where the connection returned Success.

But there is no data in the hygieia dashboard. So, i have modified the incorrect api url and verified and still it returned success, which is incorrect. Also, Testing the connection with empty url is also returning Success.

How this can be resolved and validated if it is working or not?

[],"Hi there, this project seems promising, but I'm having a really difficult time getting it set up using the docker-compose method. I have encountered several typos and unexpected errors along the way.

Particularly, the username and password used to setup Mongo and then access it from the API and from the Jenkins build collector don't seem to match up. Is the master branch supposed to work out of the box? I looked at and followed the documentation multiple times. Any help is appreciated.

Just for a start, I'm trying to get Hygieia running with just Jenkins, but the Jenkins container keeps complaining about Mongo auth failing. It appears that Mongo installs and runs with no blank username and password by default. But the `config/hygieia-jenkins-build-collector.properties` file was using a password. I have confirmed Mongo isn't using a password by trying to log into the Mongo container with a username and password, and it's denied. In the above mentioned file, I have tried blank creds:
```
#Database Username - default is blank
dbusername=''

#Database Password - default is blank
dbpassword=''
```
and also just commented out the fields
```
#Database Username - default is blank
#dbusername=''

#Database Password - default is blank

but to no avail.

365062280 @ianrossi - the username and password that is set up when creating the db can be found [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/db/db-setup.js), this is reflected in the docs. In order to run the jenkins collector, rename this [file](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/docker-compose.override.example.yml) to docker-compose.override.yml and add the environment vars for the collectors you want to run (jenkins-build for example). You can find the env vars available to you [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/build/jenkins/docker/jenkins-build-properties-builder.sh). Our docker setup is currently a work in progress and you can expect it to change in the near future.  matthewbeasley
365062768 @ianrossi - if this solves your problem to your satisfaction, please close this issue. matthewbeasley
365302370 @matthewbeasley This doesn't solve my problem. For now, I have left the docker-compose setup behind and have built the JARs on a Virtualbox VM and am running each individual process. I now have Mongo running, the API, gulp serve (UI) and the Jenkins build collector (against a local Dockerized Jenkins with 2 jobs) running and all logs seem to be running with no errors.

However, I can't get anything to show up in the dashboard. I'm stuck on this:
![screen shot 2018-02-13 at 10 18 56 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103247/36157395-b0a6b3f8-10a7-11e8-9f91-aea2c086545a.png)

First, **what does the format `<Server Name> : <Job Name>` mean?** I don't see any info in the docs about this. The gentlemen that posted [this video](https://youtu.be/Iq8M3llEp0k?t=1239) (over a year ago) doesn't show any special format for the job names, it's just the Jenkins job names. 
The logs for the build collector show this:
```

```
Previous reports like this showed when the `New jobs` were added. But what does this mean? The jobs should now be discoverable? Because they don't come up when I search in the above screenshot. 

I also keep on getting the [JWT error](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1564) which makes things more difficult.

Can anyone point me a to a known working walkthrough of how to get Hygieia set up in its current state? I have implemented a whole lot of different open source project from Chef to Sensu to Kubernetes and I'm kind of surprised that a project like Hygieia with Cap One behind it does not have better documentation.

However, this is just an observation. Based what I've seen in screenshots, Hygieia looks to be a fantastic tools with lots to offer. Any help is very much appreciated. ianrossi
365320974 @ianrossi - can you be more specific as to how what I said doesn't solve your problem? The ui, api and mongo should start up with just `docker-compose up -d`. If this isn't the case please let me know.

The JWT error is more than likely a cookie issue. If using chrome: go to [cookies](chrome://settings/siteData), search your cookies for localhost and delete that cookie. Should be good to go. This will happen when you go from the docker setup to running the jars AND your jwt has expired. If that doesn't solve your JWT issue then you need increase your jwt expiration time in your api settings. It's not clear to me exactly which issue you are experiencing but I'm confident that one of these two things will fix you up.

`<Server Name> : <Job Name>` corresponds to your jenkins server and the name of the job you are trying to track, respectively. 

 matthewbeasley
365323482 @ianrossi - also as far as the docs go -- hang tight. We are working to improve them. If you have specific suggestions then please air them out here as we'd love to hear your feedback. matthewbeasley
365323747 @ianrossi - actually don't air them out here lol. If you have the time and have specific suggestions, open a new issue.  matthewbeasley
365326190 @matthewbeasley Thanks. I know how to solve the JWT issue, I was just sharing the observation because it makes things difficult.

About the server name, I still need more clarification.

> <Server Name> : <Job Name> corresponds to your jenkins server and the name of the job you are trying to track, respectively.

What does ""jenkins server"" mean? Is this the DNS name/address of the Jenkins server? If you can give an example, that would be great. Thanks. ianrossi
365330093 @ianrossi - if you know how to solve the JWT issue then you shouldn't be seeing it. ""jenkins server"" does mean DNS name / address. If you are running jenkins locally in docker and exposing the appropriate port (8080 for instance) then Server name is `localhost:8080`. This should be available to you as a dropdown item though. Can you post your jenkins collector property file? It seems that you don't have that correctly configured.  matthewbeasley
365338402 @ianrossi  - You can assign nickname or nicename for jenkins instances so that when data is collected from multiple instances, you will know the jenkins instance - job relation. You can do it in 2 ways.
1)  You can set below values in jenkins.properties  (pull-based mechanism) 
jenkins.servers[0]=http://localhost:8080/
jenkins.niceNames[0]= give some nick name for 8080 - lets call it **ianrossi8080**
You can specify multiple server instances and nicenames with index.
2) If you have Hygieia jenkins plugin installed on your jenkins instance you will see Global Hygieia settings under - Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> configure system -> Global Hygieia Publisher Settings (Push-based mechanism)

Pull based mechanism - When you start running Jenkins collector, jobs/build information is pulled to Hygieia and you should be able to search basing on 
1) job name only  ( here my job name is HygieiaPublic)

2) nicename :  jobname ( Eg - nireesh : hyg) - it should match on partial search. We used ':' as a delimiter for nicename and job name. So if you want to search on both, make you include : in

365671959 Hi @nireeshT CC @matthewbeasley 
Thanks for this info. Is the Jenkins / Hygieia plugin required for the Jenkins build collector to work? From your post, it almost looks like the ""nice names"" cannot be used without the plugin. I'm working on getting the plugin working with my local Jenkins. ianrossi

What does this mean? Does this mean that the collector was not able to load the entire request? Because I am able to put the request into a browser and it loads all of the data to the browser. So there is something on the Hygieia side that is a problem. Please help, thanks. ianrossi
368030716 @matthewbeasley @nireeshT I'm also experiencing another issue with BItbucket. I'm getting this error and there is no actionable message in the server logs. But the JS console does show a 404 not found error. Can you help?

[],"Hi,

On days the sprint ends, the feature widget for Jira displays all 0's for all values regardless if displaying hours, story points, or issue count. 

Is this expected behavior? I am not sure how sprint information is gathered, but the tickets still have the ""Sprint"" tag for the closed sprint. I would think that displaying sprint information (regarding story points open, in-progress, and closed) would still be useful on the days a sprint ends. After the end date, perhaps displaying all 0's might be appropriate, but before and including the end date, that information still seems valid to display. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",295975221,2008,No Sprint data on Sprint end dates,2018-02-09 18:54:06,2018-09-18 14:40:08,closed,5,e-macias,,"367792933 Hi, @MarkRx @Sbrenthughes 

Just wondering if there are any possible insights into this? If this is expected behavior or not. Where is the logic for handling this? In the Jira collector, API, or does the UI handle that? Many thanks. 

To give some details regarding the issue, below are some images that I hope help describe the problem I am facing. 

This is how the feature widget appears (on days the sprint ends):
![feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2696304/36559397-b3260c92-17c2-11e8-902a-7c0d1ccc832a.png)

And here is a ticket that is currently ""in progress"", tagged with the sprint that ended (note, the sprint that just ended, is ""sprint 28""):
![sprint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2696304/36559621-663690ae-17c3-11e8-9988-bf711abc60a6.png)  e-macias
368153007 After further investigation, it appears that the logic for determining what to send the UI is applied in the API layer, specifically [FeatureServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/FeatureServiceImpl.java#L451) calls [FeatureRepositoryImpl.java](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/repository/FeatureRepositoryImpl.java#L27) to construct a query string that will determine which features belong to the current sprint.

However, it is unclear what is meant by ""**_any_**"" in the following statement: ""A feature is part of a scrum sprint if any of the following are true: -the feature has a sprint set that has start <= now <= end and end < EOT (9999-12-31T59:59:59.999999)"". Where are the ""break points"" of the statement, to determine if ""_any_"" part is true? Because it seems as if ""end < EOT"" will always be true. 

Yet the UI is receiving no values from the API. Looking some of the rest responses:
```
{""result"":{""openEstimate"":0,""inProgressEstimate"":0,""completeEstimate"":0,""totalEstimate"":0},""lastUpdated"":1519422312519}
```
and 
```
{""result"":[],""lastUpdated"":1519422312519}
```

By editing [FeatureRepositoryImpl's query build](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/repository/FeatureRepositoryImpl.java#L36) to evaluate 'sSprintEndDate' as less than the current date (rather than _greater than_), I can see what appears to be proper end of Sprint handling (see image below). Looking at some responses now gives:
```
{""result"":{""openEstimate"":6,""inProgressEstimate"":12,""completeEstimate"":42,""totalEstimate"":60},""lastUpdated"":1519422317357}
```
and
```
{""result"":[{""sEstimate"":""0"",""sEpicName"":""Technical Improvements"",""sEpicUrl"":""https://jira.com ....} 
``` 

Therefore my question now becomes, how should end of Sprint be handled? Is the change I made the correct implementation to take, or would you advice a different approach? Thanks.

**Code change**: ```{'sSprintEndDate' : {$lt : '"" + currentISODateTime + ""'}}```


![feature_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2696304/36619111-74dcab90-18a2-11e8-9f1b-92c6d088b54b.png) e-macias
368505400 Data will not show up for sprints if the sprint is over. You could change your sprint end date to be 11:59:59 and it should continue to show up the day it ends. 

If you were to make that proposed change then you would not see any data for active sprints as active sprints would be start date <= now <= end. What you have is start date <= now > end which does not make sense. MarkRx
368625186 @MarkRx, thanks for the response. I agree that my implementation is not the ideal solution. However, is there then a scenario where the ""[ENDED]"" tag will display?

In our current setup, there is usually about one to one-and-a-half days between sprints.  e-macias
368944535 Currently it appears to only show active sprints. I suppose the query could be changed so as to pick up the last sprint even if it is ended. MarkRx

[],"I have a similar issue as #1565 at the moment. We added a local user to Jira with a password without special characters. When I added this to the configuration it started working for the projects list. But when the status api is called I still get a 401. We made the user Admin. This resulted in more projects so that was prove it worked. But we still get the same error?

366198462 Hi @SanthiSridharan i am done with the CLA. depwaswho
373165511 @depwaswho94 @satishc1 - according to the [docs](https://bower.io/docs/api/#allow-root) there's no need to run bower as superuser since it is a user command. If running `bower install` gives you a permissions error then you are likely not the owner of the folder. Run `chown -R $USER:$USER Hygieia` or something similar to make yourself owner of the folder.  matthewbeasley

    In our dashboard, unable to see data for Sonar Anaylsis (it shows only line count) but not showing any data for number of blocker/critical issues present. We are using latest code of Feb-2 (commit bc6914b8d5c9a729280aed41f353e43d84fcc5f5).

     Our sonarqube version is - 5.6. I read from the posts that current code is not supported with old versions - https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1415. Is this true?
what should be the correct SonarQube version to use with latest code?. Also it will be good if we maintain compatible versions for each collectors.

--This will be your root dn
auth.adRootDn=[dc=your,dc=company,dc=com]

[],"The goal of this PR is make it so that a user can run `mvn install docker:build; docker-compose up -d` and have a UI, api, and a dev db. Then the user can rename the `docker-compose.override.example.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml`, set the environment vars for the collectors they want to run and have those come up too. The compose file also maps the port of the mongodb in order to allow you to run the api or the collectors on the host machine if you are developing them. The api port is also mapped for development of the UI. The hose names have been changed to be the set to the names of the services. Docker Compose allows you to reference other containers via service name. The db information has been changed to match the docs. 

Future plans/ thoughts: clean up the `properties-builder.sh` files. The env var names are far too long for most of them. Also the way it currently works disallows optional env vars i.e all env vars must be set or lines must be commented out of the `properties-builder.sh` file in order for the collectors or the api to start. I was thinking of doing something like this:
```
if [ -z $ENV_VAR ]
then
  echo ""collector.property=$ENV_VAR"" >> $PROP_FILE
fi
```
However, I couldn't get it to work in time. The `Dockerfile`s themselves need to be cleaned as well. The `MAINTAINER` tag is deprecated for example. I would also like to add all the potential environment overrides to the override file to work as a bit of a reference to what all can be achieved",292232116,1972,Docker compose refactor,2018-01-28 19:44:18,2018-09-18 14:40:06,closed,1,matthewbeasley,,"362758919 @tabladrum LGTM satishc1

360131669 Sure. Do you use any standard tool for your security scan and open source scan?
For test results - right now it only works with Cucumber tests and that is because the Jenkins plugin can publish cucumber test results into Hygieia. However, technically, any test results can be published if you call the API or write a new collector for your tool.  tabladrum

363137219 @binnyg - I actually ran into the same issue when I first set up my local. It seems that the collector hasn't registered itself with the db yet. Try lowering your cron to something like `*/30 * * * * *` and re-run your collector. Check the logs of the collector to ensure that you are actually getting data. After an iteration or two you should be able to set up your widget.  matthewbeasley

359554817 @binnyg 
I think the issue may be that you have never run the Github collector even once before configuring the widget. And so the in the database there is no entry for the collector, and so the UI is failing.

Please run the Github collector once. 
From the path location ""collectors/scm/github/target"" under your hygieia installation:
Run the command: 
""java -jar ./github-scm-collector-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=github --spring.config.location=<path to application.properties file>""

Make sure you have the following properties in your application.properties file.
These should be self-explanatory for the most part.
But if you do have any questions, please refer: http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/github.html

2) click on the code repo widget
3) Select ""Gitlab"" From the Repo Type selection 
4) Insert url/ Credentials
After clicking ""Save"" you don't see any errors on the page? 

When I did not run the gitlab collector I was able to get an error in the console. after I ran the collector for the first time I was then able to add the widget  Sbrenthughes

363137219 @binnyg - I actually ran into the same issue when I first set up my local. It seems that the collector hasn't registered itself with the db yet. Try lowering your cron to something like `*/30 * * * * *` and re-run your collector. Check the logs of the collector to ensure that you are actually getting data. After an iteration or two you should be able to set up your widget.  matthewbeasley
363991233 The code was about 3 weeks old, I will update again. I was able to run the Gitlab collector with necessary configuration. It is unable to retrieve repositories with my configuration.

No, I am not using docker and don't have a proxy too.

It seems like, the maven dependency below in your local repository is missing, and therefore causing the build to fail.
""C:\Users\khurshid.khokhar.m2\repository\org\jenkins-ci\main\jenkins-test-harness\1.609.2\jenkins-test-harness-1.609.2.jar;""

Could you please:
1. Do a ""git pull"" to get the latest updates from the master
2. Delete everything under your C:\Users\khurshid.khokhar.m2\repository folder just in case, and then do
3. mvn clean install.

Hope this helps. Thanks ! subodhbattina

Before configuring the feature widget, you need to run the feature collector at least once so that the collector registers itself in the database. 
So in this case, if you want to configure a JIRA widget, then you would need to run the JIRA collector at least once, and then you will see this drop down populated. Thanks ! subodhbattina

I am not sure if the APIs support programmatic configuration of the widgets via API calls. But please feel free to look at the code repository, at the path ""api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/rest"". All the rest controllers are in there. You could look into the relevant controller depending on the widget you want to configure, and see if the API supports the ""create"" operation or not.

[],"A slow GitLab server causes the Hygieia data collector to receive 'java.net.SocketTimeoutException' from the Spring socket logic.  This gets caught and rethrown as 'org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException'.  This causes a stack trace in the collector.

PATCH TO OVERCOME GITLAB SERVER REST API SOCKET READ TIMEOUT
============================================================

Trying to implement a GitLab data collector for this installation
of Hygieia had a rather interesting runtime problem.  The GitLab
the GitLab server could run quite slowly at time due to system
tuning problems.  Since a Gitlab server has a significant number
of processes running all the time, inter-process latency can be
signficant when other processing makes significant claims on
system resources such as memory and CPU time.  From a web browser,
the GitLab GUI would sometimes return an error 502 (bad gateway)
under these conditions.  From a REST API viewpoint, a socket read
timeout came back, generating the runtime exception
'java.net.SocketTimeoutException' event.  The Spring API translates
this into 'org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException',
which may be caught by the invoking Java code at the point shown
below with a (++) marking.  The (---) marking shows the segment of
stack trace applicable to the patched code and creation and recovery
from the socket read timeout event:

The patch provided here performs two actions on two files in the source
directory 'collectors/scm/gitlab/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard
/collecteur' to patch the Hygieia 2.0.4 release branch:

(1)   DefaultGitlabGitClent.java:  Retry three times if this event
      arises as detected by catch(ResourceAccessException).  If
      detected, perform Thread.sleep() for RETRY_SLEEP_TIME_MS
      milliseconds between attempts.  If this Thread.sleep() is
      interrupted--which is most unlikely--a catch(InterruptedException)
      will retry the socket read without counting an additional retry.
      Once a valid socket read is detected or the retry count expires,
      continue with current processing.

(2)   GitlabGitCOllectorTask.java:  If no data is returned from the
      getCommits() method due to socket timeouts or simply no data to
      report, defer updating the Git 'repo' object with update times
      until that condition is known.  This way, if there is a problem
      with obtaining data during the initial attempt at data collector
      startup time, the 'firstRun' condition is preserved and the next
      scan cycle of the collector will request the larger amount from
      the 'firstRun' condtion.  If it is still not available, the next
      scan does the same thing until the GitLab server finally gives up
      and produces data.  This is likely to occur since system cacheing
      will make its memory and disk resources more quickly available
      on successive scans until finally data is returned, at least so I
      suggest and speculate. Once the 'firstRun' condition is satisfied,
      successive data collector scans will request incremental results
      per existing behavior.


RELATED DATA COLLECTOR ISSUES
=============================

It might be prudent for the other Git data collectors to investigate
whether or not this issue might affect them also.  If the GitHub
data collector were to be examined, an easy way to test it would be
to set both(?) the socket connect and read timeout down from 20,000ms
to 1ms.  This would guarantee the problem to exist.  I cannot
assume which one of the two timeouts is invoked but this would be an
easy test.  It SHOULD be the read operation, since the log message
said 'Read timed out'.  The 'java.next.SocketTimeoutException' would
most certainly occur on its first invocation.  If so, then this same
patch technique could be implemented to catch
'org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException'.

All other Hygieia clients probably would stand an examination of their
read timeout conditions since the product is still quite new and usage
data from production conditions is not yet widely known.  I would
suggest that numerous other Hygieia data collector applications could
use the same scrutiny and possibly a similar approach to bolstering the
response of the application against socket read timeout conditions.

1: we are currently working on this feature for all widgets. Should be released in the coming weeks / months
2: currently only the admin user has admin privileges. Access control is a commonly requested feature and may be something that becomes a priority in the near future.
3: Unfortunately no, at the time we do not have docs on individual widget configuration

I am getting one issue in dashboard and that seems to be with session or authentication, I am not sure why it is happening. Please find the issue details below.

I have created Hygieia dashboard and when I given the url(External URL) to one of my colleague to access it. It is behaving very strangely. He has signed up to the hygieia dashboard and then login in.
After login to hygieia he was able to see all the dashboard i have created but not able to change(select any jenkins, udeploy or svn) that is fine. but when i am doing any thing in my system he was able to see what i am doing it its like mirror image of my dashboard UI to him and he is keeping his hands free and able to see what exactly i am doing.

In addition 127.0.0.1 is the current default which is rather useless as the api will never be reachable at this address.

The solution: remove the two export statements because they interfere with a user's ability to set the api hostname using ENV vars. Also change '127.0.0.1' to 'hygieia-api' since that hostname will be provided for you if you are using container linking or networking.

356987247 @matthewbeasley just one last comment... even when I was getting the encryption error, the api layer was not throwing any error. I believe that is because the catch block in the EncryptionServiceImpl is using logger at debug level.

```
public String encrypt(String message) {
        String key = apiSettings.getKey();
        String returnString = ""ERROR"";
        if (!"""".equals(key)) {
            try {
                returnString = Encryption.encryptString(message, key);
            } catch (EncryptionException ignored) {
                LOGGER.debug(""Caught encryption exception"", ignored);
            }
        }
        return returnString;

355337064 I was trying to use the bitbucket collector and I can confirm the same issue. alexandruivan
355347217 +1 rodrigocmn
356944707 Ok! I've managed to find what was wrong on my side...

@hrushie 
In my case, I made a mistake in the command that starts the API layer and didn't point to the right api.properties file. As I copied the command from the installation webpage, I didn't realise that it was a windows command and forgot to replace the backslash to forward slash (I'm running Hytgieia on RHEL). So it would be good for you to double check your start command.

@alexandruivan 
Looking at the source code, I realised that you need to add the following property to your bitbucket properties file:

git.key=<same key you've used for api.properties key>

I believe that [this documentation](http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/setup.html#encryption-for-private-repos) is wrong, as it says we should use the respective repo name as the prefix for the key property (i.e. github.key, bitbucket.key).

Hope it helps! rodrigocmn

361312867 Sorry I haven't updated - I actually ran into other issues, but haven't been working on the dashboard for a bit. 
I don't quite recall what I fixed, but the changes since I posted include:
- Choosing ""Any"" for the Team Name
- Removing logs from my hygieia-api container (I didn't have storage mounted on my test AWS instance)
- For some reason the Jira stories were listed under ""Kanban"" instead of ""Scrum"". I think this change was what resolved it for me. DimsumPanda

[],As suggested in the [docker-maven-plugin docs](https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin) we should use [this plugin instead](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven). Doing so would allow us to bind our docker image creation (and optionally an image push) to a default maven build phase. I think the only functionality we would be losing is the ability to generate Dockerfiles which the plugin warns against and it doesn't seem like we do that anyway.,280234047,1894,docker-maven-plugin -> dockerfile-maven,2017-12-07 18:35:28,2018-09-18 14:40:00,closed,0,matthewbeasley," LabelName= enhancement

Any update on this please

353399506 @Ashissh021 - if you are using api keys, please configure your jenkins.properties file to reflect that. i.e if you have `jenkins.servers[0]=http://yourserver.you` then you should set `jenkins.usernames[0]=user` and `jenkins.apiKeys[0]=yourApiKey`. This lets you avoid potential issues such as special characters being present in your username or key. matthewbeasley

[],"Currently the Github collector won't pick up your proxy settings when running in Docker. We should provide a way for users to specify their proxy. One simple way we could do this is to look for an environment variable (e.g. GITHUB_PROXY) and then [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/scm/github/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/RestOperationsSupplier.java) we can look to see if that ENV is set and if so, do something like [this](http://roufid.com/proxy-in-spring-resttemplate/). In fact, the Jira collector already does [this](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/feature/jira/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/client/JiraRestClientSupplier.java).

354357500 @Naumansh - in your jenkins collector properties file you need to specify the List index for your username and api key. So instead of `jenkins.usernames=Naumansh` and `jenkins.apiKeys=abceef` you need `jenkins.usernames[0]=Naumansh` and `jenkins.apiKeys[0]=abceef`. This allows you to have different usernames and api keys for each server. Basically the error log is telling you that it couldn't find credentials at the index that corresponds to your server. matthewbeasley

When you configure your JIRA feature widget, it will ask you to pick the project name and based on that the drop down for the team names gets populated with the teams under that project.
And when you pick the team name, the widget will then display the data for that project and team.
So yes, the widget does show data for a project and team combination.

Please let me know if this answers your question. Thanks !

347563049 Thank you for  your reply.

in fact i am able to see the teams  but it's  not by project .

for example if i choose  a  particular  project and  i want to see the  teams  for that project it's gonna  display all  the teams in jira . In addition  if i choose  a particular team it's not gonna display anything but it work  when i put ANY. It's like there is no relation between  teams and  projects.

Thank You samalg91
347573233 Yes, you are right, the team drop down does display all the teams it seems like, and not just specific to the project selected. Please excuse me, I am new to the product too, and just realized this. But thanks for bringing this to my notice. Let me circle back with my team and see if I can take this up and correct or resolve this behavior. Thanks Again ! subodhbattina

354363061 Hi @pasan96:
Following up on this issue:
After some research in my local environment what I noticed is:
In the mongo db, in the document ""collector_items"" there is a property called ""description"".
If that property has a non-empty value, you will most likely see the response coming back. On the other hand if the property is empty you will get an empty response.

If you manually enter any value into the ""description"" property in the database, you will see a response.
I am going to have to get back to you on how this value gets populated for different collector types in the database. Thanks ! subodhbattina
354363913 Its possible that at this point only the build collector has the logic to populate a ""collector_item"" record with a non-empty value for the ""description"" property, whereas other collectors don't do that and so don't have a response coming back. Thanks ! subodhbattina

Are you referring to /UI/src/components/themes/dash.less?
What gulp command are you using to serve the UI? matthewbeasley
347473362 Hey Matthew, i modified dash.css in \Hygieia\UI\dist\styles.
I am using ""gulp serve"" command for UI  GPreksha
347541639 Awesome. Gulp serve is the correct command. What ""gulp serve"" does is it takes the files in the UI/src directory, does some processing and then outputs those files to another directory 'dist'. So, if you modify the files in your dist folder they will be overridden the next time gulp runs the ""themes"" task. For more information take a look at the [gulpfile](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/gulpfile.js) and look for the line that starts `gulp.task('themes', function() {`

tldr; If you want your changes to persist, only modify files in the src directory.

346868349 There are several typos in your properties files. Please verify those going forward. Here are the ones I have found:

`dbport-27017`
should be
`dbport=27017`

Your problem is 
`jenkins.server[0]=http://admin:@:9090/jenkins`
should be **""servers""**
`jenkins.servers[0]=http://admin:@:9090/jenkins`

346160530 What command are you using to run the collector? Sbrenthughes
346232507 @Sbrenthughes , I am using java -jar Jen.jar --spring.config.name=jekins --spring.config.location=<path to application.properties>

we have production deployment on coming Monday, please can some one help me via screen sharing.

Your help is much appreciated Dhruva231
346244327 please help me to fix this issue, we have prod deployment scheduled for sunday Dhruva231

346360125 I have made some corrections to your command. The` config.name` was misspelled and make sure the `config.location` is <path_to_prop_file>/prop_file
`java -jar Jen.jar --spring.config.name=jenkins --spring.config.location=<path_to_prop_file>`

For the failing test cases you'll need to run the mvn command to skip the test cases. We are aware of the issue that is occurring with the test cases and are working on it. Sbrenthughes

346357208 @Dhruva231:
You are most welcome to try what @reddyj863 suggested and see if that solves your issue.
Else, please share the detailed error message that you are seeing now with the updated test.properties file? Run ""mvn -X clean install"" and share the log. Thanks ! subodhbattina

346530931 @subodhbattina 

Api issue had been fixed now, thanks for your inputs, but unable to run the collectors, also ""Create Dash Board"" widget or icon is not appearing in hygieia dashboard.
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1858
We are having pro deployment next week. Please suggest me, is it possible to have screen sharing session Dhruva231
346864418 Closing because original issue has been resolved. Please open a new issue for any new problems. We will get to any pending issues as soon as we can. Sbrenthughes
346128629 Please do this and let us know if it works:
In the ""test.properties"" file add the property as below: 
**auth.expirationTime=120000**

In case it still fails, Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging and share the log with us. Thanks ! subodhbattina

351561572 @matthewbeasley Sorry didn't see that i already had a response. No not using legacy linking. Basically We launch the stack using docker-compose. Both instance of hygeia use the same network to expose frontend URLs. Using secrets we can configure API_HOST env for both stack differently. But the conf-builder.sh hard codes the value instead of just using the env variable. I suggest adding a check ```if API_HOST != null then export API_HOST=hygieia-api ``` Same thing for port.  ibnjay

[],"These changes are for a gamification dashboard that encourages competition between teams by comparing them based on a set of metrics.

**Configuring Hygieia for the Dashboard**
The administrator must make an API call to the new `/gamification/metrics` endpoint to initialize the metrics in the database. The endpoint is documented in Swagger. Once the metrics have been initialized, the administrator can toggle metrics and set the score ranges in the administration page.

**Configuring the Dashboard**
To populate the dashboard, the user creates a product dashboard with at least one team. Assuming the administrator has performed the configuration mentioned above, a gamification tab will appear at the top of the product dashboard page. 

**Accessing the Dashboard**
When the user clicks on the gamification tab at the top of their product dashboard, they will be presented with a bar graph and a table showing the scores for each team.

 yks0000
363135356 @yks0000 - there isn't a property for this as the aws collector isn't intended work across regions. It is intended to collect data for the region it is deployed. In order to collect data from a region other than us-east-1 simply deploy the collector in the region for which you would like to collect data. As this isn't an issue per se I'm going to close this, but please feel free to continue the discussion.  matthewbeasley
363139618 @matthewbeasley I am running collector in us-west-2 region but it collects data for us-east-1 only. If this has to collect for Home region then ideally it should collect for us-west-2 instead of us-east-1. Please suggest. yks0000

346163099 Is `spring.config.location=application.properties` the correct path to your properties file? Sbrenthughes
346931584 @Sbrenthughes Yes, `spring.config.location=application.properties` is correct location.

347024075 So, there is a hard dependency on all the config property, If I pass all (mainly proxy) with dummy value and other with actual value (those of need), collector starts. Ideally it should not be, proxy values should not be mandatory.

> aws.proxyHost=localhost
> aws.proxyPort=3333
> aws.nonProxy=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Since Instance where Collector run are behind AWS NAT Gateway, there is no proxy. Collector started if I put above setting with dummy value but we are seeing `Connection refused ` as there is no such proxy. Seems like proxy setting is must.

347026887 I installed Apache Forward Proxy to get this going, but facing another issue as it picks us-east-1 region only. Is there any way to define aws region to pick? yks0000
347030067 I made fix to my local by changing code as follows i.e. connecting to specific region `.withRegion(Regions.US_WEST_2)` for ec2 and autoscaling.

File that needs change: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/cloud/aws/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/DefaultAWSCloudClient.java#L78

After below changes, Please go to `collectors/cloud/aws` and `mvn install` as specified in `http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/aws.html`

At `line number 78, and 83` I changed `ec2Client and autoScalingClient` as follows:

```
ec2Client = new AmazonEC2Client(new AWSCredentialsProviderChain(new ProfileCredentialsProvider(settings.getProfile()),
                new InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider())).withRegion(Regions.US_WEST_2);

autoScalingClient = new AmazonAutoScalingClient(new AWSCredentialsProviderChain(new ProfileCredentialsProvider(settings.getProfile()),
                new InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider())).withRegion(Regions.US_WEST_2);
```

Seems like you might need to add a property For eg: `aws.region=xxxx` and have it called here.

Not sure  how you made the change. I would prefer replacing `DefaultAWSCloudClient.java` with https://gist.github.com/yks0000/d2ff8f3f6d8e6074cf584da7fc49fd9d and then `mvn install` from `collectors/cloud/aws` yks0000
348093296 Hi,
Finally after replacing the file it worked. Thanks for the Help. I appreciate.
I have one more Question : 
If i need to include more regions, can i do that also? rohit0503
357072815 @yks0000, @rohit0503 - Running the aws collector cross-region isn't recommended. You should instead have separate instances of Hygieia for each region. matthewbeasley

361066175 We don't have Tempo-Team plugin lenalevy
378557490 If you do not have the plugin you cannot use the team field. Then you want to use the feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true

When true each board is seen as a team. When false the collector needs the Tempo-Team plugin. pversteijnen
379232445 I have set feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true; I am able to see the boards in the Teams dropdown. I have also set feature.jiraTeamFieldName= as blank. So the collection Teams in DB has all the boards in it. In the feature collection, there are 1000+ issues, but the issues dont have any data in the Team section. Further even after selecting the project and  Team (actually board), no issues are shown in the graph. In the code, I dont see any connection between team(actually board) and story. In our project, the same story could be in multiple boards.

My question is how is the relationship between board and story created inside Hygiea when there are no teams? In the code for Jira collector, the flag jiraBoardAsTeam is used only when populating Teams collection. See https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1644

Are there any other steps we need to do? jagnathan
453709859 @jagnathan @lenalevy - Please refer to #2667. As this is the collector rewrite in progress Sbrenthughes
348112073 Can somebody assist me ? lenalevy
348636738 Hi lenalevy: 
Please set this property ""feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true"" in your application.properties file. And then also set the property ""feature.jiraTeamFieldName"" to any non-empty value.

And then rerun your jira collector to populate team data into your mongodb.
Clear your history from your browser, and bring your UI up and see if you are seeing the list of teams now. Thanks. subodhbattina
350533006 I did all the steps , but I still didn't get the list of teams lenalevy
353977531 Could you please explain me from there exactly it took the list of teams in Jira. 
I'm  not able to fix the drop down of team list :( lenalevy
356123860 Hi @lenalevy,
I am truly sorry I couldn't follow up on this until now, but will look at this tomorrow and get back to you.
Thanks for your patience !
 subodhbattina
356376931 Hi @lenalevy,

It may be that the ""team"" collection (table) in your database does not have any team data.

1. Could you please check in your database and very if ""team"" has data in it?

2. Do you mind also going to the URL such as below, and see if you are getting any team data in response?
https://your-jira-base-url/rest/agile/1.0/board?startAt=0

3. Also, when you run your JIRA collector, please check if there are any exceptions in the log, and share if you see any exceptions.

4. Finally, just to make sure, you have all these properties below configured in your properties file before running your JIRA collector.

feature.pageSize=100

// Adjust these values as per your needs
feature.deltaStartDate=2016-03-01T00:00:00.000000
feature.masterStartDate=2016-03-01T00:00:00.000000
feature.deltaCollectorItemStartDate=2016-03-01T00:00:00.000000

// Chron schedule: S M D M Y [Day of the Week]
feature.cron=0 * * * * *

// ST Query File Details - Required
feature.queryFolder=jiraapi-queries
feature.storyQuery=story
feature.epicQuery=epic

// JIRA URL, put in your values
feature.jiraProxyUrl=
feature.jiraProxyPort=

//  Put in your values
feature.jiraBaseUrl=
feature.jiraQueryEndpoint=rest/api/2/

// For basic authentication, requires username:password as string in base64
// This command will make this for you:  echo -n username:password | base64
 feature.jiraCredentials=

feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story
feature.jiraSprintDataFieldName=customfield_10007
feature.jiraEpicIdFieldName=customfield_10003
feature.jiraStoryPointsFieldName=customfield_10004
feature.jiraTeamFieldName=customfield_11248
feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true

Thanks !

356835379 Thank you for you detail answer!
I will check and back to you  lenalevy
358332841 Hi
Thanks again for detail answer
1. The team doesn't has data :( 
I have run the following command db.team.find()
2. I didn't understand how to get any team data with URL
with the following like i'm getting to tasks of ""DE Victorious Scrum Board""  https://jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=2340&projectKey=DE
What should I change in order to get any team data ?
3. from the log : 
2018-01-17 20:24:00,011 INFO  c.c.d.collector.CollectorTask - Team Data               0        0s
attach log
[nohup.zip](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/files/1639429/nohup.zip)
4. feature.jiraTeamFieldName=customfield_11248
How I can find this id(for example : _11248) ?

Hope after your answer i will able to progress 
Thanks a lot , Lena

 lenalevy
358599292 I have try one more thing but also , doesn't succeed 
in application.properties do the following change 
feature.jiraTeamFieldName=CROSS-4257

# Set this to true if you use boards as team
feature.jiraBoardAsTeam=true

and restart the api

Also,
Can you comment out 
`dbreplicaset=false`

Try running the api layer on the suggested port 8080. Or verify that you have changed the port in the UI code to point to 8090. 8090 is a commonly used port so it could cause some issues as well. Sbrenthughes

I do have ""Task"" and ""Story"" as my feature.jiraIssueTypeNames. I tried just ""Story"" however that did not work as well (same stack trace). Moreover, I want to be able to find issues categorized as ""Task"", would they still appear even if I use ""Story""? 

I have already confirmed that the customerfield_xxxxx values are correct. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.

I see that @Sbrenthughes has already responded. 
If I may add: From what I understand, this issue that you are seeing is happening when the collector is trying to fetch Story Data.

The main properties needed to fetch Story data are: 
feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story,
feature.storyQuery=story,
feature.pageSize=100

In your case, the story information comes the api call such as this below:
https://my.jira.com/rest/api/latest/search?jql=updatedDate%3E%3D'2016-03-01+00:00'+AND+issueType+IN+('Story')+ORDER+BY+updated+ASC&expand=schema,names&fields=*all,-comment,-watches,-worklog,-votes,-reporter,-creator,-attachment&maxResults=100&startAt=0  

On the response JSON that you get back, there is sub object called ""schema"".
And it essentially defines the ""type"" for each custom field found on the issues.
And it looks like in your case that ""type"" information may be missing and hence causing the error. Thanks ! subodhbattina
349477895 @subodhbattina pretty much yes. I am not entirely sure about the ""sub object called 'schema'"" part of your comment. So I cannot say for sure that you are correct there, but you might be.  e-macias
349985053 So inside the JSON response, there is another section for ""schema"" which has type information, basically a type field in each of those entries inside the ""schema"" section. So basically that type field might be missing on the response JSON. Hope this helps. Let me know if I can go ahead close this issue. Thanks ! subodhbattina
350058736 @subodhbattina I think I may have found the ""schema"" object you were referring to:
`""schema"":{""parent"":{""type"":""array"",""items"":""issuelinks"",""system"":""parent""},
and it goes on for a while..`

I reached out to Atlassian regarding the issue being thrown by their jira-rest-java-client, and they suggested I reach out to [Adaptavist](http://www.adaptavist.com/w/) (the creators of the jira-groovy plugin). I am still waiting to hear back from them, and I was going to close this ticket afterwards, however, as this does not seem to be an issue with Hygieia, we may close this issue. I will continue to post if a solution is found for reference. Thank you for your help thus far.  e-macias
350080742 @e-macias Sure, you are very welcome. Please do keep us updated on your findings. I'll go ahead and close this ticket. Thanks ! subodhbattina
342929049 The exception appears to be thrown from 
`com.atlassian.jira.rest.client.internal.json.IssueJsonParser.parseSchema(IssueJsonParser.java:344)`
and that line looks like this: 
`(line 343) JSONObject fieldDefinition = json.getJSONObject(fieldId);`
`(line 344) res.put(fieldId, fieldDefinition.getString(""type""));`

The root json object contains in it this json `{""custom"":""com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner:scripted-field"",""customId"":12813}`. The root json object itself is pretty large and there are many inner objects that contain the ""type"" key, however this one does not and not sure what this one represents. 

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks. e-macias
344722346 I am not able to recreate this issue but if you are not behind a proxy then could you comment out
`feature.jiraProxyUrl=
feature.jiraProxyPort=`

I would also suggest using actual custom field numbers not
`customfield_XXXXX`
 Sbrenthughes
345041280 Hi @Sbrenthughes,

Regarding customfields, I do have actual numbers, I only replaced with ""xxxxx"" to post here. 

I commented out both proxy fields, however the issue still remains. While trying to recreate, are you working with a json that does not have the ""type"" field, as mentioned in my second comment?   e-macias

[],"I'm wondering if we need to chose _just one_ of the Jenkins collectors to use. We currently have a pull-based collector running, and we also have the Hygieia Jenkins Plugin on our Jenkins which is _pushing_ data to the Hygieia API.

_**Will having both collectors running at the same time cause problems with the data in mongo or with the widgets' interpretation of that data**_

If so, _**are there any features missing from the push-based collector that would make it incomplete to run on its own?**_ iow Does it matter which one you pick if you pick just one?

I'm mostly wondering if there are *known* issues when working with both. I've seen some issues when experimenting. 

One of the issues I have noticed is that Jenkins jobs will be _listed twice_ in the Jenkins widget, and you have to do some HTML inspection or trial-and-error to figure out which one you want.  

Also, there may have been some care needed when setting up the Product Dashboard, in that it needed to incorporate a Team Dashboard that was tracking a push vs. pull Jenkins collector, so that when it went and queried for commits, it was getting commits put into mongo by the right collector.
 
During demos, the pull collector also doesn't update very frequently if you're trying to demo the Product Dashboard's pipeline widget moving commits along.

FYI Some of the info about push/pull was gathered here: http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/hygieia-jenkins-plugin.html

341738734 @vijayct2001 - share UDeploy properties file. nireeshT
343880729 Now its working fine with previous versions of code.
plz close this issue. vijayct2001
344168410 @vijayct2001  Which UCD version you are working on?
 I dont think udeploy collector code is compatible with 6.2.x and higher versions.
Is there a fix from properties file? 
Can you share what exactly was the fix.

@nireeshT can you please confirm.

[],"Adds a new POST endpoint ""/quality/perftest"" which consumes a ""PerfTestDataCreateRequest.java"" model to post Perf results in Cucumber Json format.

The new endpoint allows 3rd party performance testing applications to post KPI (Key Performance indicator) metrics which out the need for a Jenkins build.

""runId"" property on PerfTestDataCreateRequest should be unique for every test execution.

353121980 @rbtr @satishc1 - I think we should not merge this PR for two reasons:
1: we need to overhaul the docker-compose file. Currently it tries to do way too much. I think it should be split up into a ""core"" file which creates and connects the UI, api, and db and then each collector should have it's own file that extends the core file. 
2: this PR is sloppy. It has white space issues, inconsistent image naming, and development trash is left in
I get that this wasn't supposed to be an upgrade and was just intended to recapture the 'clobbered' changes but I can't imagine merging this one without a follow up PR and I don't think that's worth the time when we really need to change the entire file in the near future anyway. matthewbeasley

to 1.  If you want to say that this isn't worth merging because the whole compose file needs to be scrapped and redone, fine, but let's be clear that this changeset only puts things back have been removed accidently. 

Which brings me to 2.  I evidently didn't make myself clear enough. I didn't write any code in this PR. All of this was already in master at several points in the history. This cleanup was done just in git, to consolidate and put back changes that had already been **approved and merged** but were then undone by a later merge with an earlier root commit.

353430279 @rbtr - believe me, you’ve made it very clear that you didn’t do any original work in this PR. We really appreciate your interest in this project and if you would like to submit a separate PR that targets compose v3 or even recaptures the changes cleanly we would love to review that, but as stated above we don’t feel that it is worth it to merge this one.  matthewbeasley
340236931 i think the only change relevant to me was the appdynamics collector. i have checked that and it seems ok.

overall I think its time to refactor the dockerfiles and docker-compose to support running in docker swarm or kubernetes environments and that it is time to review how env variables and the collector properties scripts are used - the pattern is working ok, but is at odds with newer docker secrets / docker config.

For now though it is a good start to move away from v1 and its implied ENV variable sharing between containers so Im in favour of this change virtualpeter

@crouchar @clcain @nireeshT - Here is the error I get

 crouchar
346162166 Regarding this test failure: ""DefaultSecurityTest.registerUser"":
Please include this property shown below in the ""test.properties"" file, and re-run the build with -X option (mvn -X clean install).

**auth.expirationTime=120000**

Let us know if this solves the problem. Thanks. subodhbattina
347689684 @ikfas:
Wanted to touch base and check if you were able to update your ""test.properties"" file and re-run the build. You could set  **auth.expirationTime** to higher value like may be **1200,000**, and try again. So **auth.expirationTime=1200000**. Please let me know when you get a chance where you stand with this? Thanks ! subodhbattina
350087401 @ikfas: Since we didn't hear back from you, assuming this issue was resolved based on the latest suggestions posted. Closing this issue. Thanks ! subodhbattina
340799099 @clcain  current version on Hygieia is 2.0.5. You working on latest code base? nireeshT
340869221 Yea the latest is broken for me too. Tests fail on the API component. crouchar
341194612 @nireeshT I was running `mvn clean install package` while on the latest version of the `master` branch. At the time of posting, that was commit 817b176f0f40b04cc2ec229d4c4c182fb80a80f5.

I don't see a tag for 2.0.5, where can I get that version? clcain
341198273 I tried again today, the build succeeds on `master` as of commit 4c7389513c023759a1513c5eb05d160425040744. clcain
341207332 The clean isn’t working right then. If you do a fresh git checkout and wipe out your .m2 repo you can replicate the test failure on HEAD of master
 crouchar
341267780 @crouchar The latest version works for me, even on a different machine with a fresh clone of the repository. clcain
342158781 I'm having the same problem. I tried multiple git clone but I'm still having the error.
 Did you discover what was the source of it ?  ikfas
342168918 My work around was to pull the tag for 2.0.4 and install that one.  Note
the only gotcha was that I had problems with some of the collectors on
2.0.4, but it looks like they are all dependency/timing issues.  If you do
a mvn install 2 or 3 times they will eventually resolve themselves and
compile.


 crouchar
342169673 @clcain @ikfas, realistically i think this ticket should be reopened.  multiple people are reporting the exact same issue. crouchar
342209508 @crouchar @clcain @ikfas  - Please share error log  nireeshT

344612336 You can create a user for your local without using LDAP. Hygieia needs users to be able to create dashboards etc. Once you create a dashboard you can view the dashboard without logging in.

339115999 @htvan1  you can choose to create dashboard using templates(Capone template) instead of selecting widgets.  nireeshT
339118274 @nireeshT  to my knowledge we can't remove a widget from a template on the UI.
We like the cap one template but do not use the monitor widget.  There is another template and it has a chat widget we do not use.   If you have an easy guide to modifying those templates in the code that would work for me too. htvan1
339165610 @htvan1 - as a quick workaround go to Capone.html and remove line of code containing <widget name =“monitor” > nireeshT
339167580 @htvan1 containing widget name = monitor nireeshT
334021990 I was just going to go in the template and remove it in the code.  You can use the customize widget lay out but I am finding that super buggy. htvan1
334148427 @htvan1 can you point to the bugs around widget customization? Will help us to fix it. @nireeshT @satishc1  tabladrum
334546545 @mrdmanohar @htvan1  - Follow below steps 
1) Sign up as user - ""admin""
2) Login as admin
3) Go to admin-> settings ( which is gear next to user name once logged in) 
4) Click Manage templates 
5) Create new template -> Name template and select widgets for template. In your case you can exclude Monitor and Deploy 
6) Save 
7) Go to Hygieia landing page-> Create new Dashboard 
8) Select From Templates option 
9) Select custom created template from drop down. 
10) Save dashboard. 

Alternatively, you can create dashboard with selected widgets while creating dashboards. In this case you need not login as admin, any user will do. 

Refer https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1581 for screenshots. 

Let me know if you see any issues.

I really like the idea of this feature, but I am finding a lot of bugs.  
2 issues can be seen here, widgets not sizing as I tell them to in the template and 2 of my widgets dont even show up...  If I do a standard size 3x3 and dont touch the layout it works BUT the widget info does not really fit in that space.

[],"Hi Everyone,

I've have my Hygieia environment up in running, now it's just a matter of configuring the collectors to work with our systems. I'm curious if there's any documentation on what the collectors actually need permissions-wise from their respective systems.

For example: My Jenkins collector has access to builds, but the log shows a 404 when accessing any information about those builds. When the Hygieia service account was created for using the Jenkins API, I did not know it needed those permissions. What else does the jenkins collector need access to?

It would be great if a contributor familiar with the collectors could document exactly what each collector is looking for when making API calls to those systems.

When the hygieia server need a proxy to access the jenkins server, the user can't configure it in current jenkins collector, so I make some changes in HudsonSettings.java, RestOperationsSupplier.java and application.properties to support configuring proxy.

1.Change the HudsonSettings.java file
Add a new property
private String proxy;
public String getProxy() {
return proxy;
}
public void setProxy(String proxy) {
this.proxy = proxy;
}
2.Change the properties file.
Add a new propery ""jenkins.proxy"".
3.Change the RestOperationsSupplier.java file.
Add the proxy when create RestTemplate object if proxy has been configured.

public class RestOperationsSupplier implements Supplier {

private final HudsonSettings settings;

@Autowired

1. I am not using any deployment tool like Xl deploy or U deploy for deployment. So I cannot configure these collectors.
2. We are using **jenkins** and **manual** process for all builds and deployments.
3. I am currently using **jenkins collector** to pull data to dashboard. But in this case I am not able to get data for pipeline. Do I need to configure ""Jenkins Hyginea plugin"" to configure pipeline?. Currently I don't see any data under pipeline widget. 

Note: I have added pipeline ""feature.dynamicPipeline=enabled"" but still i dont see any difference.

443786464 @rohit-rehan  In jenkins post build action you will need to configure all the details required. You can also confirm if the jenkins is pusing the data by manually loggin in to mongo DB or the api url and check if the data is present.

Note: Jenkins collector does not push all the data related to  particular job. Have you installed Hygieia jenkins plugin.

332355893 Please open a new issue for this. nitin1706
332364059 Thanks.. please close this.

I opened new one --  appdynamics performance collector not working #1745

 sachins50
391665918 can any body share your application.prop file for appdyanmics  anayyadav
332259365 I recreated DB user using script as given here : http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/database.html


I ran appD command again - but saw same error coming.
Also my prop files are as shown above.

I can login to Dashboard at this URL http://localhost:3000/#/
But here my username and password is same:- ""dashboarduser"" and ""dashboarduser"". My bad!

how can I change this password to match one in the props file - dbpassword ?

Will changing Password from dashboard UI - fix this issue?



 sachins50
332261957 If the same password is working for api, it should work for appDynamics collector as well. The above error can happen when collector couldn't find the properties file, and instead using the default one. 
What command you are using to run appDynamics collector and what's your properties file name.  nitin1706
332266387 Thanks.

I m using this-

C:\Hygieia-master\collectors\performance\appdynamics\target>java -jar appdynamics-performance-collector-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=appdynamics --spring.config.location=""C:\Hygieia-master\collectors\performance\appdynamics\application.properties""

 sachins50
332298919 I think it is a not able to locate properties file, `--spring.config.name` tells it that properties file name would be appdynamics, while in location, it is not seeing properties file with that name, rather it is available as application.properties.  If properties file name is application.properties, we don't need to specify `--spring.config.name`. 

Can you try running appDynamics collector with following command:
`java -jar appdynamics-performance-collector-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=""C:\Hygieia-master\collectors\performance\appdynamics\application.properties""` nitin1706
332304993 Thanks.


Now I could see different error on AppD performance command:

[],"Hey everyone,

I am having an issue with my deploy widget. I have configured the Hygieia-Jenkins plugin on my Jenkins machine and it pushing data to my dashboard however, it doesnt seem to be using the latest deploy information. I have attached a picture below for clarity. 

Thanks,


![deploy issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/30824963-4ff3c378-a1ff-11e7-925d-30b7e6e04fc3.PNG)

337069761 @nireeshT  fixing the cicd-gates.json issues does not seem to effect this issue in anyway besides removing the error from console and showing the health score in the UI.  The main bug remains the same.

@kavalpatel15  inside the product dashboard are you seeing the commit window update?  Mine has not updated with new commits I can see in the Team Dashboard. The Build window does update and like yours the environment windows are blank.

Side question for either of you what does the date/time underneath each title mean?
example: Build - ""21D 22H 28M""

337108117 @htvan1 I am seeing the Commit Window update within the product dashboard and i am able to track the commit over to build when Jenkins triggers the build process. My issue is now solely with the deploy windows and updating after a commit is built and is being deployed/ has been deployed.

331995042 can you share complete screen shot of these builds? nitin1706
331996105 I am not sure what you mean by complete screen shot of the builds? Do you want to see the build widget information? Just trying to clarify to get you the right information. kavalpatel15
332009050 I wanted to see details of all builds. 
This date which on top which you underlined is the date job last ran for the configured artifact (the one you circled may not be the artifact job is configured for). I will confirm after looking into code for this. nitin1706
332207396 Also something else brought to my attention was the product dashboard. It used to show information across the pipelines but now it the dev environments are empty. Even though we have deploys to dev.

![product dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/30864320-39261f72-a2a1-11e7-8ce1-9997cd6a1fd6.PNG)

To address you statement i spoke with other members of my team to check the build information they said the build information is correct but the deploy information is showing the old.

Edit:

I also found this error this morning when loading up the product dashboard.
![product dashboard error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/30935629-408cdb26-a39f-11e7-963a-7755552954f1.PNG)

334022324 I am seeing the same issue when I click into the deploy widget :  /
I thought it was because I am using a custom deploy collector we made and I just messed something up... happy/unhappy it's a boarder issue than than.  htvan1
334552214 @htvan1 @kavalpatel15  - This issue is related to CICD maturity score which is displayed next to ""DevOps Maturity Score"" on UI. Work around to this issue -> Create a collection ""maturity_model""  and copy contents of https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/UI/src/test-data/cicd-gates.json in to ""maturity_model"" collection.  That should clear this error.  nireeshT
334552876 @kavalpatel15  - For proddashboard -> commits not moving to environments, will you be able to submit a dummy commit to repository, build and deploy to DEV and let me know if you can see the commits moving.  nireeshT
334553495 @nireeshT We have tried doing that with a dummy commit to our repo and tracing the build but nothing is moved to DEV.  I will have the team try again and get back to you. kavalpatel15
334761225 I implemented the fix for the product dashboard but it still wont populate any environment after build as shown below.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/30864320-39261f72-a2a1-11e7-8ce1-9997cd6a1fd6.PNG)


As for the issue with the deploy widget, we decided to drop the environment_components collection and push just a dummy commit and we can track it through the pipeline on the component team dashboard.  But not on the product dashboard. 
![deploy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/31292978-83d5bbd6-aaa3-11e7-8f84-a4e421703dd2.PNG)
 kavalpatel15
335068742 @nireeshT 
that got ride of the issue seen in console, however, env data still does not show up. (and for me commit data does not show up) just the BUILD data.  
(side note cicd-gates.json is not valid json, has an extra set of """" around the rules.) htvan1
335558554 @nireeshT 
We decided to setup Hygieia on a different server to if the issue persisted and both issues with the product dashboard not showing deploys and the deploy widget not showing updated information. I checked the db and had all the correct information but it seems as though the UI is not refreshing with the updated information. Below are a few screenshots of the different issues and of the db showing updated info.

335567108 @kavalpatel15  - After you configured pipeline, can you try below steps
1) Do a commit into repo - see if it commits shows up on code repo widget
2) Run build - see if build shows up on build widget
3) Run deploy job - See if deploy details shows up in Deploy widget and pipeline 
4) refresh product dashboard and see if commits are moved to DEV stages .

Reason I asked is, after configuring pipeline with stages, above steps will trigger to adjust the data across environments and this is required just once after configuring pipeline.  nireeshT
335582252 @nireeshT 
We followed your steps and we are able to track it from commit to deploy into our dev1 environment however, the updates do not show on the product dashboard nor the widget. I have attached all the screenshot. 

![dummycommit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11862646/31404980-a5104e08-adcb-11e7-9f03-dec9ab1b7997.PNG)

After taking these screenshots we tried the following:

Test 2:
We did another commit and build both of which we were able to track. We deployed to the other DEV environment and it showed up when clicking on the environment name on the deploy widget but the date did not get updated. It also showed up in the pipeline. It did not change anything for the DEV environment in the product dashboard however.

Test 3:
We switched our two DEV environments around on the pipeline tab of the team dashboard and tried to deploy out builds there again with no luck on updating the deploy widget date nor on the product dashboard.


 kavalpatel15
336911777 @nireeshT  I was speaking with one of the UI developers here and he said the issue w/ the product dashboard maybe with the code using bower instead of lodash to try and pull to latest data. I wanted to ask if lodash should be responsible for pulling that data?  kavalpatel15
336913659 @kavalpatel15  Yes, functions in lodash will pull latest data. Do you see any error in browser console after you configured cicd-gates.json nireeshT
336970346 @nireeshT  No errors after configuring the cicd-gates.json kavalpatel15
337069761 @nireeshT  fixing the cicd-gates.json issues does not seem to effect this issue in anyway besides removing the error from console and showing the health score in the UI.  The main bug remains the same.

@kavalpatel15  inside the product dashboard are you seeing the commit window update?  Mine has not updated with new commits I can see in the Team Dashboard. The Build window does update and like yours the environment windows are blank.

332566017 @ivo5307 : what is it you are looking for. This error above seems to be related to SSL certificates. You can install certificates to your jvm.
Try launching your jenkins collector specifying the location of your truststore.

[],"Hi all,
I had a question about the Hygieia-Jenkins plugin. During setup on the Jenkins machine you provide it with a Hygieia API url so the plugin knows where to push the data. I have multiple teams on a single jenkins machine and they each want to  stand up their own instance of the Hygieia Dashboard. Is there a way to provide multiple Hygieia API urls on one jenkins machine?

thanks!",260307336,1738,Hygieia-Jenkins plugin question,2017-09-25 14:56:14,2018-09-18 14:39:50,closed,3,kavalpatel15,,"332565020 @kavalpatel15 : what do you mean by own instance of Hygieia Dashboard. Do you mean own dashboard or own instance of Hygieia stack (api, DB, and UI).  nitin1706
332602572 They would like their own instance of the Hygieia stack. kavalpatel15
332948291 It will not be possible to send data to multiple Hygieia instances from same jenkins server. 
Hygieia-Jenkins plugin is configured at Jenkins server level and it can send data only to one Hygieia instance.
You can configure to have one Hygieia instance shared across teams and each team having their own dashboard. nitin1706

I'm getting the same error. Looks like login seems to be not happening. Also I can see the same 2 exceptions in log file that you were mentioning above. I tried giving the full path to properties file and even added  --spring.config.name=dashboard.. still I see those 2 errors in log file. can you please help?

Thank you in advance. vishnuvangala

486536833 @sundeepk1 
I'm not getting this error anymore. I have configured only minimum required properties in api and restarted it and I don't see any issue now.
One thing you need to note is.. whenever you restart api.. we should clear cache/history from browser and try to open the page again and relogin. otherwise.. you might see some errors in logs and you'll not be able to login.
Also, just check this api property value.. it should be more otherwise its gets logged of frequently. auth.expirationTime=7200000 vishnuvangala

486536833 @sundeepk1 
I'm not getting this error anymore. I have configured only minimum required properties in api and restarted it and I don't see any issue now.
One thing you need to note is.. whenever you restart api.. we should clear cache/history from browser and try to open the page again and relogin. otherwise.. you might see some errors in logs and you'll not be able to login.
Also, just check this api property value.. it should be more otherwise its gets logged of frequently. auth.expirationTime=7200000 vishnuvangala

[],"I think there are some improvements that can be made to the audit service. It looks like the service scans through the pull request comments and the pull request review comments. If any comments are present (and not by the PR author) then the pull request is considered reviewed.

See https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/200f9154a9956283eb16ce01b4c5aa16b43b4d5a/api-audit/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/service/AuditServiceImpl.java#L290-L311

There are a couple of improvements that can be made:

A pull request review has a state. I see the states ""PENDING"", ""APPROVED"", ""DISMISSED"". There should also be a ""Request Changes"" status but I don't know is the corresponding API state. I think the service should be checking the state of the pull request review instead of looking at the review comments. The current implementation will accept ""Pending"" or ""Request Changes"" pull request reviews. That seems wrong. Here's the GitHub API: https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#get-a-single-review

There are external services that provide approval management. For example, Hygieia uses https://github.com/lgtmco/lgtm. It would be useful to allow a repository to configure Hygieia to recognize these services for approval management. These services work by setting a git commit status. The repository could register the status context with Hygieia, such as ""approvals/lgtm"" and that status check could be tested. https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#list-statuses-for-a-specific-ref

Currently the audit service tests for the presence of any pull request comments. This doesn't seem like the correct behavior. For example, I could make a comment ""Don't merge this. There's a NullPointerException on line 10"" and that would be considered as peer review. I would remove the testing of pull request comments. Another option is to reproduce the functionality of a service like https://github.com/lgtmco/lgtm. It's a non-trivial implementation to reproduce that functionality.

I'm happy to submit pull requests on any of the three comments above. Just wanted to get feedback before I start writing code.",259836361,1735,Audit service improvements,2017-09-22 14:39:03,2018-09-18 14:39:49,closed,18,mspiegel,,"334242725 I'm working on some improvements to audit an external service such as LGTM.

334260757 @mspiegel Current state, all actors have ability to turn on/off lgtm as well as github protected branches.  We can reduce the amount of potential malicious actors by restricting who can alter github protected branches.  And that someone should maybe be a single release engineer or someone who isn't contributing directly to the repo.  

In the end, you're still going to need to trust *SOMEONE* with admin access to these tools.  I don't believe anyone can code a way around a people problem.

I totally agree malicious actors should be addressed, but I feel current state of peer review checking doesn't allow for all cases of valid peer review (I was originally going to open an issue here because I found the same exact block of code you did). poemdexter
334432267 @tabladrum @poemdexter @mspiegel @jdamick Thank you for the inputs and feedback. We will research it further and put in improvements. satishc1
335835805 I'm going to make an attempt and incorporating the changes above. I'll submit a PR mspiegel
331474748 Great feedback. Agree with (a) checking PR state. 
(b) We discussed the option of checking status of approval management hook. The problem is doing so is that those hooks can be turned off by a repo owner and turned back on after some direct commits to the branch by-passing PR mechanism and we won't know about it. There is a solution but may be a little overkill - we will need to trap into GH event stream. (c) We discussed this too. From a review comment perspective, a text saying ""LGTM"" is as good as ""I am merging it anyway"". IMO the correct way to do this would be to use some light weight sentiment analysis on the review comments and that itself will open up a good set of analytics points. 

Thoughts?
 tabladrum
331487409 On (b) I think only the repository administrators can enable or disable a service hook. I think you have to trust the repository admins. For example, the admins are the ones who can enable or disable a protected branch in GitHub. They are also the ones who decide whether or not admins can commit directly to a protected branch. So I think they have the equivalent or superuser or root access to the repository.

On (c) looking for the comment string ""LGTM"" would be an improvement over the current implementation. Sentiment analysis seems overkill IMO.  mspiegel
331487993 The admins can also rewrite history on a protected branch, if they allow admins to commit directly to the branch. mspiegel
331904548 yeah i would say you need to have trust at some level, so i would vote for (b) rather than (c) which would likely be a never ending stream of keyword matching or sentiment analysis.. jdamick
331909189 We should be able to support any code review process - LGTM, GH's own or anything else. tabladrum
334035750 Is there consensus on taking this course of action?
- use the GitHub API to check the GitHub Pull Request Review status?
- use the GitHub API to check the GitHub status checks for LGTM? 

I can submit a patch with these changes once we have consensus on what it needs to look like. Currently on master if someone types a comment ""This pull request has a bug please don't merge it"" the AuditStatus.PULLREQ_REVIEWED_BY_PEER status is set.  mspiegel
334159174 Are we expecting this to work only with LGTM -i.e. detecting LGTM webhook etc? Or are we saying we will look for the word ""LGTM"" in the review comment? If it is the second one, I am concerned about this review comment ""This pull request does not LGTM"". If it is the first one, how do we make it work with other review tools including GH review? tabladrum
334234463 I've received confirmation from several people that the LGTM tool is not required for SOD or PAR so we shouldn't rely on it too heavily.  The github API should be checked for review status and then maybe rely on LGTM comments afterwards.  Also LGTM can be turned off just as easily as protected branches in Github.  poemdexter
334235608 Another thing to think about is the fact that many teams rely on the maven release plugin to handle versioning.  Every release creates 2 additional commits directly on the release branch changing the pom versioning. poemdexter
334236378 Those commits are marked as such so that they are excluded (need to confirm @satishc1 about the exclusions) from this. tabladrum
334238224 I've come across another team as well that creates commits as part of their release due to the fact that maven release plugin requires git to show no outstanding changes.  So this would be ignoring commits directly to release due to some build step as well as maven release plugin.

Overall, I feel like Github can easily be configured to control peer reviews and it's strange to see devs have full admin access to repos they commit to as part of a larger team. poemdexter
334239145 Send me (via offline) an example of such commit.  tabladrum
334242208 There are two approaches to enforcing peer review. The first is to use the GitHub Pull Request Review feature and to check the box on the protected branch that requires a PR Review. The second is to use an external service such as the LGTM service and use a GitHub status check. Both approaches are valid. Using an external service can provide additional features that are not (currently) available in the GitHub Pull Request Review. For example, if you want to mandate a specific set of people to be reviewers. Or you want to require two or more reviewers for your pull request. Or you want to require that the author of the pull request is in the group of people who have signed a contributor license agreement.

What I'm requesting is that Hygieia support both of these approaches. I haven't had a second person confirm this, but it looks like the current implementation in Hygieia is broken? It just looks for the presence of comments. It doesn't test the GitHub Review API to check that the review was approved.

None of these these approaches address the issue of a malicious actor. The current implementation in Hygieia also doesn't address this question. I've been investigating some alternatives to solve that problem. Is that not a separate issue to be addressed? Can we first improve the current Hygieia peer review service? mspiegel

404208573 Hi

we had the same error with TDS server as Nithin had

`message=[LDAP: error code 53 - Unwilling To Perform]; nested exception is javax.naming.OperationNotSupportedException: [LDAP: error code 53 - Unwilling To Perform];`

the work around mentioned by @justinzyw works . In application.properties I set the following

`auth.authenticationProviders=STANDARD,LDAP
auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://ldapserver:389/dc=company,dc=org

auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0}
`

----------------------------------------------------

**To set bind user and password**

Note: we did not have to do the below to get ldap to work but during process of debugging, i could set userDn for binding by editing api module class com.capitalone.dashboard.config.WebSecurityConfig.configureLdap((AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)) method as follows

`private void configureLdap(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        String ldapServerUrl = authProperties.getLdapServerUrl();
		String ldapUserDnPattern = authProperties.getLdapUserDnPattern();
		if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(ldapServerUrl) && StringUtils.isNotBlank(ldapUserDnPattern)) {
			
		       ContextSourceBuilder cbuild =auth.ldapAuthentication()
			.userDnPatterns(ldapUserDnPattern)
			.contextSource().url(ldapServerUrl);

                        cbuild.managerDn(""cn=user1,dc=company,dc=org"");
			
			cbuild.managerPassword(""Password"");
`

I have hard coded the user and password here but you may move it to applications,properties to be read by authProperties

1. check if these metrics show up under: **`api/projects/`** rather than **`api/resources/`**
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44396930/sonarqube-web-api-api-resources-not-returning-all-projects
3. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26620609/sonar-webservice-api-resources-endpoint-returns-no-metrics nitin1706
331941463 Thanks a lot. So it looks like I need the collector to fetch the projects from ```https://devsupport-sonar.it.global.snakeoil:9009/sonar/api/projects/index```, extract the resource key there, and then fetch the metrics from eg, ```https://devsupport-sonar.it.global.snakeoil:9009/sonar/api/resources?resource=com.snakeoil.digital:artiname&metrics=ncloc,coverage``` equick
332029395 This could probably be cleaned up but the following patch is working for me with Sonar 5.6 now. Instead of 498 projects, I receive around 9531 projects.

The error coming out was Caused by:` java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.antlr.runtime.RecognitionException`
but if you look in v4.3 this is found at `org/antlr/v4/runtime/RecognitionException.class`
not `org/antlr/runtime/RecognitionException.class` equick
329199518 Two things that maybe issue: 
1. command you are using to run the collector doesn't mention properties file details. Please re-try using the command `java -jar jira-feature-collector.jar --spring.config.name=feature --spring.config.location=/path/to/feature/properties/file`
2. Did you build the Hygieia project using `mvn clean install package` before building the feature collector? nitin1706

Thanks for your update.
I have just tried those but no luck still:
```
$ mvn clean install package

327926316 Hi, 

I am getting OrgaizationName-develop in dashboard, whenever there is develop branch triggers for any projects its reporting here.

It should be Organizationname-repo-branch.

I would appreciate if you have any ideas to share.

328001396 @sujaydevops1  -  At present, we have below ways to identify your job based on nicename , in your case nice name is Org name. 

If using Jenkins collector, specify nice name for your jenkins server as below in your jenkins properties. You can specify nice names for all servers based on indexing.  In your case, you can specify customized nice name for your jenkins instance and that should help you find the correct job. This route should work for you.

Eg: jenkins.servers[0]=http://***jenkins.com/job/folder_level/
       jenkins.niceNames[0]= give nice name here 

If using Hygieia plugin in Jenkins, you can specify server name in Jenkins -> Manage Configuration-> Global settings 
     Specify server name field - give nice name here - which is what you are doing now. This does not help much if you wan

While configuring dashboard - build wiget, you can search with format - nicename : jobname 
In you case - nice name (mentioned in prop file) : develop.

328249605 This works for me in build perspective ! but how about in Deployment perspective? 

There are pipeline driven deployment jobs in github organization.  embedded shared libaries in jenkins drive the pipeline based on user input.

I have this for now  : 

Global config  for hygieia api URL and nicename for Github org name
all deployments coming under same org name , its indexing in the same. Please assist me if you have curl with json call to post deployment info.

"
[],"A blind mount allows you to overwrite the contents of an existing directory in docker. This PR moves the properties files for each docker image to a separate /config folder. This allows the config folder to be mounted to use config files on the local file system by setting SKIP_PROPERTIES_BUILDER=true. Doing so is advantageous as it is more flexible and powerful and because the docker properties builders often are overlooked when new properties are added.

I also fixed a part of #1207 that was missed - the ENC() block should not be in the default docker images. Since it was in hygieia-api it requires all images to use jasypt with no way to disable it. To use jasypt nothing changes - pass in / store in a compose file a JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD and the property encrypted with ENC().

This also includes changes from #1674 as I needed to update that as well for this.

Docker blind mounts: https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/

Example:
```

    container_name: hygieia-api

You can also achieve the same using docker run passing in environment variables and a mount.",255348728,1708,Move docker config file location to allow for mounting configs,2017-09-05 17:15:51,2018-09-18 14:39:48,closed,3,MarkRx,,"350310321 @MarkRx, I'm currently reviewing this PR and I have a couple of concerns. First off, I think it's a really good idea to pass in a properties file instead of using env vars to create a properties file at run-time. That being said, I've ran into some issues.
- 1: I'm currently using Docker For Mac version 17.09.0-ce and have mounted my config folder as you have suggested in your example, but unfortunately it seems that the folder is mounted too late in the container creation process and therefore isn't present when the last line of the Dockerfile is executed. So with a compose entry like this:
```
hygieia-api:
  image: hygieia-api:latest
  volumes:
  - ./logs:/hygieia/logs
  - ./config:/hygieia/config
  environment:
    - SKIP_PROPERTIES_BUILDER=true
```
and running `docker-compose up` no config is loaded since the properties builder doesn't run and the volume isn't mounted yet. As far as I can tell the only way we can get the properties file loaded in time is by modifying the Dockerfile to COPY the file over.
- 2: This issue isn't as much of a deal breaker, but still a problem. You used $MONGO_HOST and $MONGO_PORT. These are only available when using [legacy container linking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/) which is a problem in that it we will have to take it out later when we introduce networks and we **will** have to introduce networks at some point. Especially if we ever want to run our containers in production. So changing the names of these env vars really isn't that big of a deal since there isn't really a standard but we shouldn't assume that Mongo is always going to provide these for us.

Here's an example of the env sharing present when using linking but missing using a network:
```
# save this as links.yml
# run 'docker-compose -f links.yml up | grep alpine'
# env vars are shared when using legacy container linking
mongo:
  image: mongo

alpine:
  image: alpine
  command: env
  links:
    - mongo:mongo
```

```
# save this as network.yml
# run 'docker-compose -f network.yml up | grep alpine'
# with networks there is no env var sharing
version: ""3""

services:
  mongo: 
    image: mongo
    networks:
      - my-network

  alpine:
    image: alpine
    command: env
    networks:
      - my-network

networks:
  my-network:
```
In the logs you'll notice the vars present for the linked example but not for the networked one

[],"First of all thank you committers for managing such beautiful and a complex project.
Came across to this recently and started playing with it. Have some minor feedbacks for the improvements however the major pain point I faced was rebuilding the whole application stack. Which takes quiet some time to finish given the size of the code base.

I have some idea of improving the build time.Its like this:
  Application is composed of building the api.jar and then docker image. What we can do is to separate out the these two steps. Once we do it, the framework part (mostly api.jar) will not be rebuild and instead can be pulled from the maven artifactory (or we can pull it from this gitrepo via maven build process). Now most of our efforts will be used in building the image and not the api.jar.

In case some users need to create custom collectors/connectors, they can easily do in the second maven based project which builds docker image by leveraging packages from api.jar.

The same refactoring can be done for UI.

363140786 @pravsingh - we currently support building only pieces of Hygieia. In order to accomplish this, simply navigate to the directory of the component you would like to build (e.g api) and then run `mvn clean install` or `mvn clean install docker:build` if you want docker images. This will build only the desired module. matthewbeasley

[],"I am configuring Hygieia following the setup instructions on the capitalone site. After a fresh clone, I then run the following:
` mvn clean install package`
      `mvn docker:build`
      `docker-compose up -d`
      `docker exec -i -t hygieia_mongodb_1 bash'
      'mongo'
      'use dashboarddb'
      'db.createUser({user: ""db"", pwd: ""dbpass"", roles: [{role: ""readWrite"", db: ""dashboarddb""}]})'
      'exit'
      'docker-compose restart` 

When I go to sign up the console outputs: 

> GET http://localhost:8088/api/dashboard 502 (Bad Gateway)
> GET http://localhost:8088/api/dashboard/mydashboard/undefined 502 (Bad Gateway)
> POST http://localhost:8088/api/registerUser/ 401 (Unauthorized)

The 401 was a 502 until I changed the docker-compose hygieia-api environment variable SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST to mongo from mongodb.

I'm an intern tasked with setting up a proof-of-concept Hygieia dashboard for our CI pipeline. Any tips would be appreciated. I'm confused on how to point the api container to the mongodb container. My docker experience is beginner.

Case 1: Re-produced this issue(#1317) by deleting components and then try fetching dashboards. 
Case 2: For delete scenarios, it need to delete component first and then delete dashboard. Use Case: In current code, it deletes the Dashboard first and then tries to delete component. In case, components are not deleted, it will fail with error message that dashboard cannot be deleted, while dashboard actually would have been deleted.  nitin1706

 Notes:I executed the ""chmod -R 777 /home/yangqian/Hygieia-master"" to resolve the permission issue.

329798056 @tsr2017 cool. no prob. satishc1
444417438 Can you explain how you imported the cert into the jvm of the collector?
I don't get it? Do I need to embed the certificates into the 'api' docker image and use keytool to send it to the collector? I'm a bit lost here, trying to hook up bitbucket but I'm getting the exact same error jochenparm

329214987 @tsr2017 Your bitbucket collector is launching the process with application.properties.  In that file make sure you have a line that says
bitbucket.key= satishc1

I have added bitbucket.key= ""secret key""
as well but still getting the same error. tsr2017
329279819 @tsr2017 Run the collector in the debugger. First check whether you are able to decrypt the password that you saved. If that is accurate then the next step is to attempt to connect to bitbucket.  satishc1
329280081 @tsr2017 Also cleanup your properties file. The spring config name you are using is bitbucket. Why do you have github in the properties file ?

329297458 I can see the commit if I hit 
https://repo.cmp.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/myproj/repos/ios/commits?until=develop&limit=10

on browser and I am already logged into the repository server.

But getting above error while try to get data from collector. tsr2017
329298335 @tsr2017 Ok good.. now you are past the decryption error. Now the issue is with the ssl cert. Import the cert into the jvm of the collector. satishc1
329299087 @satishc1 Do I need to Obtain and Import the Server's Public Certificate? tsr2017
329299385 All my setup is on mac. I didn't get **"" Import the cert into the jvm of the collector.""** this

329794622 @satishc1 Thanks for the help. I am able to get the data now 👍 :-)  tsr2017
329798056 @tsr2017 cool. no prob. satishc1
444417438 Can you explain how you imported the cert into the jvm of the collector?
I don't get it? Do I need to embed the certificates into the 'api' docker image and use keytool to send it to the collector? I'm a bit lost here, trying to hook up bitbucket but I'm getting the exact same error jochenparm

[],"When I run ""mvn package install"" from the project root directory, it fails on the api step and skips the rest. It fails due to three tests failing. I couldn't find any mention of these tests in the issues here. It was building fine before I pulled the latest commits.

Failed tests:
`DefaultSecurityTest.adminUser_deleteDashboard:103->authenticateAs:155 Status expected:<200> but was:<401>
  DefaultSecurityTest.login:132 Status expected:<200> but was:<401>

I'm using all of the defaults described at http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/setup.html

[],"From Dashboard I  see the list of Bamboo plans in the Build Widget's Build Job. After I selectecd one and saved it, there is no build result showing up for last 2 weeks.  But latest builds were done about 3 days ago and I can the build stats from URL in a browser. Under bamboo\logs\buildcollector-2017-08-28-0.log I see both the plan and nested plan data are pulled in. 

Here is my configuration.  Any reason why does Dashboard not show anything on Build widget?

[],"The big change here is moving ""teamId"" from a path param to a query param.  Gitlab has a concept of subgroups, and the subgroups are delimited by ""/"".  You can't send a ""/"" as a path param obviously, and url encoding it is still not accepted by most servers unless explicitly turned on.  The other change was moving the query parameters in the angular app into an object, instead of doing string manipulation which is very brittle.

And I am following below steps

1)Start MOngo DB
2)Run API
3)Run the Jenkins collector -
4)from Hygieia/collectors/features/jira
mvn install
then run .jar inside
from Hygieia/collectors/features/jira/target

java -jar /Users/tkhan6/McDonald/Hygieia/collectors/feature/jira/target/jira-feature-collector.jar --spring.config.name=application.properties --spring.config.location=/Users/tkhan6/McDonald/Hygieia/collectors/feature/jira

5)Start UI

I have tried by running UI first and then collector
but got the same error.
Just wanted to know what is the correct approach.

I got following exccpetion

According to the UI setup guide, 
### Running
""In terminal navigate to the project root and run ```gulp serve```. Should serve up on port 3000. ""
I go to the /home/yangqian/Hygieia-2.0.4/, then execute ""gulp serve"" ,but still failed because can't find the module ""/home/yangqian/Hygieia-2.0.4/gulp"".

Thank you!

my solution is as following.
step1, use non-root user, to the project-root directory
 cd /home/yangqian/Hygieia-2.0.4
 sudo chmod -R 777 ./Hygieia-2.0.4
 then mvn clean package -pl UI docker:build

step2, go to /home/yangqian/Hygieia-2.0.4/UI/node_modules/gulp/bin
with root user
node gulp serve

result:server is up.

My questions:which use should we use to execute ""mvn clean package -pl UI docker:build"", where and which user should we use to execute ""node gulp serve"".

Build the individual docker images and just do a ""docker-compose up"". Keep the docker-compose.yml file only for the db,API and UI layers and override it with a docker-compose.override.yml for the individual collectors. You might need to tweak the files a little bit to get it to work. It is not the most smoothest docker setup that I have seen. srinathanand

324673493 @MeghaMyWork that looks nice! However, in the new doc you're calling the db dashboarddb while it is called dashboard almost everywhere else and in all the properties files examples, even in your example under http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/api.html

326410392 The xml files must be archived in the job. When the collector polls Jenkins it gets the files from the archive for the job. Not sure about the 403... stevegal
326411214 (As well as being configured for the file pattern for each type) stevegal
326425953 Yeah. That's a bug re: collector. Looks like some tidy up code went wrong before I committed. I'll correct stevegal
326433139 raised #1699 to correct stevegal
326468216 @stevegal And also, setters should be added to the Artifact class, otherwise the artifact fileName won't be mapped correctly, it will be null, and that gives a regex exception in predicate. iampasan
326498587 Hmm... fileName or filename... I'm not sure your root cause is right, but I need to check that casing. I'll update the conversion test and see... stevegal
326508504 see #1700 for fix stevegal
327314130 now that's merged, does it work for you @pasan96, @anuradha92 ? stevegal
327415145 yes. It's going to the db but it doesn't show up on the UI anuradha92

I have a job with unit tests that's been built a few times in my Jenkins instance.. 
Commands used to run - 
mvn clean install package - in the project root 
java -jar jenkins-codequality-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=..\application.properties - in target folder iampasan
323932647 Pulled the latest code and built again, the collector runs past this point now, having some other run time errors, will post as different issues. If there's something wrong with the properties file, pl let me know. Thank You  iampasan
324040053 @pasan96 :  you are using jenkins-codequality, check your properties to update this one from Jenkins to Jenkins-codequality:

Change this property:
jenkins.servers[0]=http://admin:dfc4bfdd3b45bba81d094ef987803b8c@localhost:8082/jenkins
to 
jenkins-codequality.servers[0]=https://jenkins

* Configure a Feature Widget with valid project information (Cap One Template)
* Once the data is populated, Click on the '+/-' to expand the ""Issues In Progress"" list

Actual Result:
""Issues In Progress"" box is expanded based on the number of items which makes it really long when there are more number of issues. Because of which user have to scroll all the way down to see the information in Code Repo Widget

Expected Result:
Size of ""Issues In Progress"" list should be limited with a vertical scroll inside. This allows users to access the information in Code Repo Widget easily and a better user experience

Please update your documentation on how to run the API part of Hygieia. It doesn't work in a Docker container if you follow -

use db
db.createUser({user: ""db"", pwd: ""dbpass"", roles: [{role: ""readWrite"", db: ""dashboard""}]})

I think the same problem will exist with Docker Compose as well. Closing this for now. srinathanand

321567947 if you have already created users, you should be able to log in by clicking on 'Login' button and entering user credentials. If user doesn't exist, you can signup by clicking on 'Sign-up' option on the bottom of same screen.

321577526 ok. This doesn't show any error.

I tried to do something same, I see the similar screen when I am not logged in. I can just see existing dashboards available, but no option to create one. 

Maybe you can try to sign-up with a new username using sign-up screen.

321579630 @nitin1706 After sign-up new user (sheriff) I am back to the same ""No result"" screen. UsmanSheriff
321593752 Does mongo details given here helps to resolve this puzzle?

Time being I am using non authenticated mongo. Is that a constraint in Hygieia setup?

Created couple of users through the Hygieia login screen shown in below snap. After login it goes back to ""No Result"" screen. That is, I don't see Dashboard creation buttion.

One more thing I noticed the Dashboard DB doesn't shows ""Build"" as said in the documentation. Even though my jenkins collector is running. Could that be an issue?

321853724 Jenkins collector is not required for this functionality.

I tried to use similar properties and commands. It works well for me.

I get the this 'blank screen and no option to create dashboard' when I click on Hygieia button on top left corner without logging in.
To Log-in, I clicked on button next to 'Login' text. and once logged in, I see create dashboard option. nitin1706
322089350 @nitin1706 Could it be browser problem? I am using chrome. Even I tried with incognito mode (Shit+Ctrl+N) after clearing browser cache. Also, it is not working in IE. UsmanSheriff
323776862 from your screenshot posted in first comment, it seems like you were getting option to create a dashboard. Is this issue resolved?

 nitin1706
323793709 @UsmanSheriff if you are still experiencing issues can you try a fresh install of Hygieia/Mongo and follow all the instructions posted? Specifically the mongo setup. Once you follow the instructions that are suggested create a new issue if you are still having problems. Sbrenthughes
334189851 Hi,

I am facing exactly the same issue. Can somebody confirm if this was resolved and what steps were taken.

Everything worked fine yesterday but facing the same issue today. The login does not register inspite of seeing the username fed into the mongo db properly. 

Any help is appreciated. Could it be related to the security of mongodb and the expire time for JWT ghost
334200900 @hemantanna555 can you create a new issue. Post your properties file and logs of the issue. Sbrenthughes

[],"This directive ""deleteConfirm"" can be used for the deletion confirm for any component across Hygieia.
For this, we just need to add attributes:
1. ""delete-confirm"" - that invokes a sweet alert for confirmation with cancel and delete buttons
2.  confirm-action -the function called for deletion, needs to be assigned to this attribute .

For example :
<a href id=""deleteDashboardButton"" delete-confirm confirm-action=""ctrl.deleteDashboard(myitem)"">

322472432 did you try changing application properties?
dbport=27017


I tried using the same command on my mongodb:
'db.runCommand({whatsmyuri : 1 })'
and port in output information is different from what I am connecting to.

I will suggest using 'dbport=27017' in all the properties and trying again. nitin1706
322845762 Yess finally I got the error resolved...
I reinstalled mongo db and placed the dashboard.properties file inside target file in API.
And started API using the command:
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.name=api --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties.

It Worked Finally.

Thanks for all your valuable inputs...

[],"Data does seem to get loaded from what I can tell when watching the calls back and forth. But something gets weird if you try and log in or create a user when using:  gulp serve --local true
Also the documentation does not state what the password is for user created in the test data: someuser

When it tries to authenticate on a log in, the header is missing. response.headers()['x-authentication-token'])  ...in fact no headers are set, the response looks completely different from the one you will see when you do not load with --local true. 
Logging in and creating a new user works fine with one's own data.

321012971 Going through your properties file, just noticed this:

Try using cron instead of corn.

I tried replicating this, gave me similar error. nitin1706
321263729 Please verify that your properties match and reopen if you have any issues. https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/build/jenkins Sbrenthughes
321264616 thank you @Sbrenthughes  and @nitin1706 ... it works... able to publish the values. nag10
320668292 What are the commands you are running? Your properties are also not correct. Jenkins - https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/build/jenkins.  Sbrenthughes
320705847 @Sbrenthughes: Below is the command I used..
java -jar jenkins-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar

Could you please let me know the error in the property file. nag10
320738541 Your command should look similar to something like the below
`java -jar jenkins-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=jenkins --spring.config.location=path_to_properties/jenkins.properties`

and 

`jenkins.server=https://username:password@192.168.0.108.8080` should likely be something like
`jenkins.servers[0]=https://username:password@192.168.0.108:8080` I am not sure why you have a . before 8080. Sbrenthughes
320955813 @Sbrenthughes No Luck....
tried with the below command.
 java -jar jenkins-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=jenkins --spring.config.location=../jenkins.properties

getting the same errors.

320967475 Your application properties seems correct except this:

I faced the same issue when it was not able to find the properties file. Maybe you want to check if its able to read properties file.
 nitin1706
320969590 `spring.config.location=../jenkins.properties`
should be

320976698 You left out the` jenkins.servers[0]=` Sbrenthughes
320977525 @Sbrenthughes  added that.... same error..

320987416 I re-created this error, this is not due to Jenkins ip or its username or password, if that would be incorrect, it will fail when it will try to get the data. This is coming when I am giving a properties file which doesn't exist. nitin1706
321007365 @nag10 what is the name of your properties file? Is that the one you are using in your command? Sbrenthughes
321007468 @nitin1706  i could see the properties file in that path.can there be any other reason ??

command i used:

**java -jar jenkins-build-collector-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=jenkins --spring.config.location=/opt/hygiea/Hygieia/collectors/build/jenkins/application.properties**

root@instance-1:/opt/hygiea/Hygieia/collectors/build/jenkins# ls
application.properties  docker  logs  pom.xml  README.md  src  target
 nag10
321012971 Going through your properties file, just noticed this:
jenkins.corn=0 0/5 * * * *

Try using cron instead of corn.

I tried replicating this, gave me similar error. nitin1706
321263729 Please verify that your properties match and reopen if you have any issues. https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/build/jenkins Sbrenthughes

I want to use http://localhost:8080/api/deploy/
I just tried basic auth with the curl example, I kept getting jwt token malform.... which confused me.  I then tried to make the jwt follow a guide on how to put those together (first time using that type of token).  I am assuming the secret I am to use is whatever I set in dashboard.properties  auth.secret= 
For the second part of the jwt, I think the payload I just put user:myusername
Not sure if anything else was needed...or if that was even needed.


I keep getting ""message"":""JWT signature does not match locally computed signature. JWT validity cannot be asserted and should not be trusted.""   not sure what is going wrong.

324036793 I like the idea of being able to customize the widgets that show up in a dashboard. I can see cases where people want to exclude certain widgets or replace them with others. This may become more useful as more widgets are developed.

As for individual dashboards I can see it being useful to have a small set of global templates but allowing the owners of each dashboard to further customize it as desired. MarkRx

319404913 Will this give us the ability to remove the existing templates, such as ""Cap One"", and ""Split View"", or just add new ones to the list? rob-miller-777
319406614 @rob-miller-777  - It will add new ones to the list keeping the existing ones intact.  nireeshT
319414946 I don't know that I see the value in having templates for team dashboards.  In my opinion, first thing you should do is choose your dashboard type, (Team, Product, executive in future), name your dashboard, then click create.  If you choose a team dashboard, your page will initially be empty, and at that point you would configure the widgets you want to see, similar to your manage templates screenshot above.  Then you can go about configuring each of the widgets on your page. I also think it would be a lot more valuable for users to have the ability to add/remove widgets even after creating their dashboards, which could be accomplished with this flow. rob-miller-777
319416114 I agree with Rob. The original intention behind #1143 was to allow the users to see which ever widgets they wanted. Having templates managed by a single (admin) source still restrains the consumer to whatever templates exist. I do really like the way that manage template screen turned out, but if that could be a ""Widget Selection"" screen or something per dashboard creation that would fit the intention of my PR a little more. brennanananan
319434192 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan  - I do agree with you where users can add/remove the widgets on their respective dashboards. But the main intent of this PR is to adhere reusability and maintainability. Manage templates enables to create different templates and those can be reused across and always there is an option to edit as required. Through enterprise level perspective, we may have hundreds of dashboards which may become hard to manage when they are configured at dashboard level with enterprise standards(enforce to use only selected widgets). So we did move manage template functionality under admin which enables single source for configuration. We can have hybrid model where a custom template is created, give access to user to hide/show a widget and set a flag(enabled/disabled) to see widgets only they wanted. This change will be persistent and once they come back to dashboard, they see all the dashboards enabled to see. In this way, control will be at admin(for creating custom templates) and with the user to enable/disable the view of widgets at dashboard level.

Use case
1) Admin creates custom template with widgets -
 Build,Deply,Feature,Performance,Quality,CodeRepo
2) User uses custom template to create a team dashboard. 
3) On dashboard we will enable configure button which will open a dialog box which user can select/deselect the existing widgets on dashboard. 

I am working on configurable dashboard which will enable step 3, drag drop and resize functionality.
 nireeshT
319442945 So is the functionality you are looking for the ability to control what widgets are available for users at an admin level? rob-miller-777
319446208 @rob-miller-777  - Build , CodeRepo, Feature, Monitor, Deploy, Performance, Quality. It can be extended to pipeline and Cloud as well. nireeshT
319447478 I'm asking from a higher level.  For example, Company A doesn't want their employees to use the monitor widget, so they create a template without it.  Is that your intended use case? rob-miller-777
319448896 @rob-miller-777  exactly nireeshT
319478603 For that use case, I think I would rather see an admin page for toggling available widgets rather than controlling it through templates.  Especially if the default templates are going to stick around, because if you wanted to get around the custom templates not having the monitor widget, you could just create a ""cap one"" dashboard. rob-miller-777
319483687 @rob-miller-777  means admin-> Edit Dashboards functionality should be extended to configure widgets as well? like edit dashboard title, owner information, we should have one more tab to choose the widgets for dashboard. correct me if I am wrong.  nireeshT
319484483 No, I am thinking we have a tab on the admin page where you can disable a widget application wide.  So you couldn't add a certain widget type to any dashboard in the app if you didn't want to. rob-miller-777
319489351 @rob-miller-777  - Sounds good, what if we want to disable different widgets for different applications with in enterprise.  nireeshT
319490006 Should probably work similar to the feature collector widget where it doesn't even show up as an option until the collector has run.   rob-miller-777
319520552 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan I think what @nireeshT is saying is that by having templates, you can choose to disable different widgets for different user bases.

If we go the route of adding widgets directly from the admin tab, I don't see how you could control disabling a widget for a certain user but enabling that same widget for another user.
  satishc1
319688588 I would be fine to keep templates if they weren't mandatory for the user. So create a ""Team Dashboard"".  Then on the team dashboard page, you could add the widgets you want, or choose a template.  And even if you choose a template, it would just be a starting point, so you could add or remove afterwards. rob-miller-777
319694590 I agree with Rob. Templates should be optional, but a good starting point if the user chooses so. brennanananan
319793000 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan That makes sense. @nireeshT Lets discuss. satishc1
320028288 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan  
We have discussed the design and this how we plan to implement.
1. On the Create Team Dashboard dialog box, we’ll have a toggle where the users can choose either Widgets or Templates. If they choose widgets, it will prompt them with the re-worked Template dialog box but its just going to create widgets directly.
If they choose templates, then it supports the existing flow.
2. Templates need to be supported because existing dashboards need them. You could choose to delete all dashboards and recreate them, but that would be a lot of work.
3. On the existing “Configure your Dashboard” dialog box, we’ll add a tab ""configure widgets"" that supports re-configuring your widgets if you didn’t choose a template to begin with.
4. The Admin screen will have a template option.
Let me know your thoughts.  nireeshT
320141361 @nireeshT I disagree with your second point, my solution was to just show all widgets for ""legacy"" dashboards until users decide to hide elements they don't want. Otherwise I am fine with what you've proposed.  brennanananan
323920920 @tabladrum @satishc1 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan  - Updates for PR includes 
1) Enable option to create dashboard by selecting widgets or selecting pre-existing/custom templates
2) Widget Management modal appears when user choose to select widgets option and will be able to save selected widgets to create dashboard.
3) Existing dashboard widgets can be edited (Add/Remove widgets) via -> edit dashboard-> Widget Management
