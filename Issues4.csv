No worries ,
Go to Hygieia-Master -> UI and open README.md.
Scroll to the end and you will get, Encryption for private repos

Now generate this key and add it to the properties file of both api and github i.e
Hygieia-master -> api -> target -> (properties file) -> key = (new generated private key )
Hygieia-master -> collectors ->scm -> github -> target -> open your properties file ->github.key = (new generated private key )

This key will help you encrypt & decrypt your credentials .

Now run api then gulp serve then collectors.

If You Are Using GHE - (Enterprise Github)
**ask your IT to provide you with username and password to bypass the enterprise (GHE) login. GHE logins are different as compared to that of normal github logins as you enter your Windows login or LDAP or (many options). if you dont have such login then your collector should perform properly.

I had previously been unsuccessful in getting GHE populating my dashboard but now I have figured out. Hope you have got everything, any doubts do ask me . golokeshpatra45
317581871 @golokeshpatra45 thanks for the information. I don't see the error after setting up the encryption.

I guess the error message displayed ""Error encrypting password"" should be modified to something more descriptive and informative. kumarvarun1252

316797613 @bseelam-hub The jenkins plugin talks to the api .. and not the ui.  You have misconfigured the jenkins plugin to talk to the UI port. Change it to 8080 (or whatever port your api is running on) satishc1

**I did some debugging and found that this method  **onAfterSave(AfterSaveEvent<Build> event)** is getting called recursively**.
As in the class com.anthem.dashboard.event.BuildEventListener line no 122 we have this condition
if (hasFailedBuilds) {
                buildRepository.save(build);
}
So whenever build repository save happens, onAfterSave method is being called, and it is beiong called again and again.

My IT provided me some credentials which bypass the Security Gateway page, and show me the metrics on Hygieia. I dont know if I can help you any further, because these steps did work for me.

In the credentials , username was the github enterprise organization I was given access to (It is this organization that holds the various repo's under it). and the password was provided by my IT, maybe its the access token .

313348481 Hi All,

Can we set proxy in github collector in hygieia? ashu5993
313656632 @ashu5993 
Go to Hygieia-Master -> UI and open README.md.
Scroll to the end and you will get, Encryption for private repos

Now generate this key and add it to the properties file of both api and github i.e
Hygieia-master -> api -> target -> (properties file) -> key = (new generated private key )
Hygieia-master -> collectors ->scm -> github -> target -> open your properties file ->github.key = (new generated private key )

This key will help you encrypt your credentials .

Now run api then gulp serve then collectors.

**ask your IT to provide you with username and password to bypass the enterprise (GHE) login. GHE logins are different as compared to that of normal github logins as you enter your Windows login or LDAP or (many options). 
If you dont have such login then your collector should perform properly without doing the above.

I had been unsuccessful in getting GHE populating my dashboard but now I have figured out. Hope you have got everything, any doubts do ask me . golokeshpatra45
314060426 Hi golokeshpatra45,

thanks for responding for the issue i have already done the encyption part before and did it again. but still no luch we dont have any GHE credentials for github its a issue that and i m able to find the commit link in github w/o any issue.

I hope you know the fact that, you need to put the same github.key in api properties too . golokeshpatra45
314335322 Hi @golokeshpatra45 ,

no signs were there regarding security. i directly login into GitHub there are no restriction for that.
i have set the key above in dashboard and application file both are same.
still don't know exactly what are you referring too? ashu5993
314359638 Do you use enterprise github ?

 golokeshpatra45
314372986 yes we use the enterprise github. ashu5993
314376995 Ok,

My IT provided me some credentials which bypass the Security Gateway page, and show me the metrics on Hygieia. I dont know if I can help you any further, because these steps did work for me.

In the credentials , username was the github enterprise organization I was given access to (It is this organization that holds the various repo's under it). and the password was provided by my IT, maybe its the access token .
I will inform you If I get any lead on it.

We don't deploy with Jenkins. The dynamic dashboard (#888) was made to stitch together the components on-demand. It basically is a PipelineServiceImpl with additional logic at buildPipeline along with tweaks and disabling the bounding mechanism since it didn't work. I think I made some tweaks to inefficient algorithms while in there. It would be great if these could share the same backbone and only differ in an extra step that way changes to the dynamic pipeline are not overlooked. If you have a branch with changes to the PipelineServiceImpl I can peak and try out the dynamic pipeline. MarkRx

Cheers

314487877 @nireeshT didnt make a difference to me mate, i'm afraid.. after rebuilding the docker containers, i just deployed them using the same data in mongo, could this cause an issue?

Also, i thought i would just test with and without Dynamic Pipeline.

With ""FEATURE_DYNAMIC_PIPELINE=enabled"", i have commits in both the commit, and build stages, but nothing in dev stage.

with ""FEATURE_DYNAMIC_PIPELINE=disabled"" i have no commits in the commit stage, commits in the build stage, but none in dev stage.

We dont have Pre/Pro stages yet btw, not sure if this makes a difference?
 willuk2010
314515615 @willuk2010  - FEATURE_DYNAMIC_PIPELINE=disabled flow seems to be working. share a screenshot of your prod dashboard along with Mongodb pipeline collection for team dashboard. Want to see why commits are not moved to DEV. 
Check below configuration
1) Configure post build action for DEV jenkins job 
2) Do a commit and run DEV jenkins job
3) Deploy widget should show up your app name and DEV job 
4) Configure pipeline widget with DEV 
Share screenshots for prod dashboard, team dashboard deploy widget and pipeline widget and MongoDb pipeline collection showing stages -> commits.

5) refresh prod dashboard.  nireeshT

Please update your comments with Jenkins version as well. 
I have made few changes in product dashboard and jenkins plugin , pull the latest code from master and do below steps. 
1) mvn clean package on Hygieia
2) get the latest hpi file from Jenkins publisher plugin project
3) install in Jenkins 
4) Do a dummy commits in your github and run Jenkins build and deploy jobs for that repo.
5) Configure build and deploy widgets
6) Configure pipeline with available environment stages in dropdown
7) Add that team dashboard to product dashboard
8) Now repeat step 4.
9) Refresh prod dashboard

We don't deploy with Jenkins. The dynamic dashboard (#888) was made to stitch together the components on-demand. It basically is a PipelineServiceImpl with additional logic at buildPipeline along with tweaks and disabling the bounding mechanism since it didn't work. I think I made some tweaks to inefficient algorithms while in there. It would be great if these could share the same backbone and only differ in an extra step that way changes to the dynamic pipeline are not overlooked. If you have a branch with changes to the PipelineServiceImpl I can peak and try out the dynamic pipeline. MarkRx

However these changes don't get applied to the other collectors such as gitlab and subversion.  Because of this, all the SCM collectors have different functionality.  What would you think about adding another abstract class, or an interface that all collectors of a type would have to extend/implement.  For example, for the SCM collectors, they could extend a new ScmCollectorTask, which would have methods you have to implement for collecting commits, issues, etc... We could create these for all the different types as well.  That way when new functionality is added, it will force all the collectors to stay in sync. In cases such as subversion where there is no concept of ""issues"", it would just be a ""noop"" for the implementation of that method.

319265130 Hi @nireeshT,

Sorry to say, but this is like the 3rd time I am asking if I get the list of metrics you added in your AppdDynamics dashboard and I still did not get that detail. And hence my answer would be the same that... i left it for more than 30 mins and I still do not see any data coming back to Hygieia. Hence, request you to please give me the below detail : 

--> What are the metrics you have in your AppDynamics dashboard?

My dashboard has below metrics....

}

if this is what you are asking for.. nireeshT
319415264 I am afraid that is not what I am looking for. 

So, one of the parameters we are passing in Appd properties file is 'appdynamics.dashboardUrl'. You are giving the URL of a dashboard that you have setup on AppDynamics. I am asking what widgets and what metrics did you configure on that dashboard of AppDynamics. 

Like my dashboard if you see in my prev comment is configured to show Average Response time, calls per minute, etc.,

it would be great if you can give the snapshot of your dashboard from AppD. ganeshmuralidhar

310572642 +1. I would like to know the same. ghost
310678344 I believe you would do this via your environment - specifically `~/.aws/config` or environment variables.

The SDK *should* pick up [AWS environment variables](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html), i.e. `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, so you can try setting those on your system. I'm not sure if there's any logic in Hygieia to override that kind of stuff, though (haven't looked). mrpudn
311237491 After setting the environment variables we got below message and it is working default region only(us-east-1).

311246955 This makes me think you did not set your environment variables properly:
```
2017-06-27 02:40:00,094 INFO c.a.a.p.i.ProfilesConfigFileLoader - Skip unsupported property name AWS_DEFAULT_REGION in profile [default].
```

`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` needs to be an **environment variable**, not something you set in your AWS config, i.e. `~/.aws/config` - please make sure you've set this properly.

Reference:
- Linux/Mac:
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables?answertab=active#tab-top

Can some one help me with the steps to follow with the latest Hygieia

[],"Hi, 

I have Sonar 6.3, latest Hygieia code, but it only appears to be pulling ncloc values, (that's all i see in Mongo db code_quality)

     - MONGO_PORT=tcp://hygieia-mongodb:27017
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE=dashboard

      - SONAR_VERSION=6.3
      - SONAR_USERNAME=xxxxx
      - SONAR_PASSWORD=xxxxx

If i go to the API in sonar, for the project in question, i get the following values.

https://uk-sonar.almuk.xxxxxxxxxx.corp/api/project_analyses/search?project=com.xxxxxxxx:dualadmin-api

Any ideas?

310368999 something else to add, if i change the sonar.metrics, to have say.. ""quality_gate_details"" first, instead of ""ncloc"", only ""quality_gate_details"" data is written into the code quality table..

It appears to be collecting data for only the first metric, and no more.. willuk2010

```
# Sonar server(s) (required) - Can provide multiple
sonar.servers[0]=http://sonar.company.com
# Sonar version, match array index to the server. If not set, will default to version prior to 6.

```

310387722 arrrrrrrrrrrrrg..

I'm using dockers, the issue is that the shell script to create the .properties is wrong (sonar-codequality-properties-builder.sh)!

Currently its,

#Sonar Metrics
sonar.metrics=${SONAR_METRICS:-ncloc,line_coverage,violations,critical_violations,major_violations,blocker_violations,sqale_index,test_success_density,test_failures,test_errors,tests}

Instead of

#Sonar Metrics
sonar.metrics **[0]** =${SONAR_METRICS:-ncloc,line_coverage,violations,critical_violations,major_violations,blocker_violations,sqale_index,test_success_density,test_failures,test_errors,tests}

Changed, and its working, thanks for pointing me in the right direction @AuditHawks

310573225 @ganeshmuralidhar  give it some time to collect data and it should show up on the screen. You can also check MongoDB - performance collection to see appD data. You should see data similar to screenshot.  Reopen if issue is not resolved.

1. What are the metrics you have in your AppDynamics dashboard?
2. What is the URL you mentioned in your Appd.properties file? (if you share a screenshot with details masked, it will be helpful) ganeshmuralidhar

Can someone share with me the structure of how it looks the MongoDB collections with data from Jira?
I'm working on a customization for another feature collector but even though I have data in my db I don't get anything populated on my dashboard.

I would like to understand what values is this collector (Jira) expecting.
This is an example of one document from my feature collection.

419647691 what was the solution, if you can elaborate a bit, it may help many. Seems like i am having same issue. Sandeep-Mandori
419657355 Well, in my case it was 2 things (that I remember so far)
1. I registered my collector under a different name (than Jira) and that was causing an issue when showing it in the UI
2. The core project wasn't updated to reflect the new properties I added for the Feature model and I had to update it (core project) then update its dependency within the API project so the UI could finally pick the missing data

They put a bit of information around the schema here
http://capitalone.github.io/Hygieia/dbschema.html

But yeah basically is that if you make changes to a collector you gotta follow the chain
Collector > Core > API > UI irvingoe

[],"Started to implement a v2 of the rest API.  Before we started to do the entire thing, we wanted to get a small piece out there to get some feedback on, so we rewrote the ""Dashboards"" controller.  We followed what we had mentioned in #1444 , and implemented v2 using Spring's hateoas library.  You will notice upon making a get request to ""/api/v2/"", the response will contain links to resources in the application.  Right now there are only a couple relating to dashboards, but eventually there will be more as more controllers are added.  Making a get request to the dashboards endpoint will give you the list of dashboards, and each of the dashboards will have a link to itself.  We also updated swagger to separate v1 from v2, so you can see the different versions of the api.  We tried to avoid making changes to the backend services as much as possible, but there were a couple small changes that had to be made to make this work properly, but nothing that breaks backwards compatibility.

307451594 I got that issue yesterday when I fetch the latest changes.
The way I fixed it was running mvn clean package install again from Hygieia root folder, then I was also having problems specifically related to a dashboard I created ""manually"" in MongoDB, I created a new dashboard and then it was all good.
Another ""hotfix"" I did in my development was to make sure I was logged out before running 'gulp serve' again
 irvingoe
307467906 I think for me it's because I had started a collector (bitbucket) where i am using that key before i run api. If i run API before running collector. it's not throwing error. 
I am having a really weird issue with bitbucket collector. if i pass my repo URL it's adding 'cket.org' in the URL. I have tried with private and public repo. both are having a same issue. 
@irvingoe  - have you ever configure Bitbucket on Hygieia? I really need a help to find solution. I explained issue here #1461 
Thanks  meet101

I did some research to find out why URL is saying Unauthorized. I have followed password encryption details provided on ReadME of UI Section.  Then i tried to check the URL by browsing it locally. It didn't work. I removed **/cket.org** After removing it. The new URL is https://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/awsagero/testapi/commits?sha=master&since=2017-05-23T17:52Z   It asked me for authentication, entered credentials and it worked.

I don't know, why in my URL it's adding /cket.org. can you please let me know how to remove it from URL. is it configured anywhere in DefaultBitBucketCloudClient? I am not adding it anywhere in bitbucket.properties file.

I am not using the URL in UI https://bitbucket.org/awsagero/testapi

307464176 @sraghu-rs - can you tell me what URL are you using in UI? My URL is not working still. I am now trying with public repo to just make sure what is the issue. Public repo url is not working as well. If I put the correct Repo URL which is **https://awsagero@bitbucket.org/awsagero/test.git** 
then I am getting error  **404 Not Found:https://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/cket.org/awsagero/test/commits?sha=master&s                                                                     ince=2017-06-09T17:40Z as it is adding cket.org**

Does anyone successfully integrated Bitbucket with hygieia?? meet101
307565338 @meet101  - I have done successful integration BitBucket Server with Hygieia. 

However, i am also struggling with BitBucket Cloud.

I am able to get the Repo count and commits from BitBucket cloud but dashboard doesn't display anything.

For the Repo URL i have used https://bitbucket.org/{user}/{repo}.git but this repo is public repo. 

At the end, i have to connect Private Repo and pull required information.
Now, i am getting error ""JWT signature does not match locally computed signature. JWT validity cannot be asserted and should not be trusted."" when i use key and git.key attribute in properties file.

Not sure, is this a bug or missing something in the integration. sraghu-rs
307578995 @meet101 - I was able to successfully integrate with BitBucket Cloud Private Repo. 

I have done below steps.

1. Logout from UI dashboard
2. Stop UI, and api
3. Generate key using 
java -jar <Hygieia folder>/core/target/core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption

4. Add the key to api.properties
key=WAFADdbmI3xArl2SXUmubdlK4CPyJWuK

5. Add the same key to BitBucket.properties file (to make sure, i have added both git.key and github.key)
**git.key=WAFADdbmI3xArl2SXUmubdlK4CPyJWuK
github.key=WAFADdbmI3xArl2SXUmubdlK4CPyJWu**K

6. Since my private key login depends upon SSO, i have to increase the field length of Repo username in the widget UI.
**UI\src\components\widgets\repo\config.html**

7. Start API
8. Start SCM collector job
9. start UI
10. Login to UI and configure repo widget
**Repo URL - https://bitbucket.org/{user}/{repo}.git**
_E.g- https://bitbucket.org/awsagero/test.git_

11. Enter the credentials of the Private Repo and save.
12. Once you enter the repo information, SCCM collector job will pick the repo URL and pull the information.
13. Refresh the dashboard to view the data.


Hope this helps.

Raghav

[],"We are not using Temp Team plugin in JIRA cloud instance. JIRA collector is able to fetch all the project related information. However, when we try to configure feature dashboard, i do not see any drop down values in Team Name.

In the JIRA collector, we have not put any custom field against ""feature.jiraTeamFieldName"". Here is the snippet of the application properties.

""Team Name"" is a mandatory attribute in the widget hence we are not able to create dashboard at this moment.

A month back, in different instance, we were able to set up widget and there we received ""Any"" as Team Name (without Tempo plugin) but i see some changes to the config.html (compared with month old config.html code)

Can you please suggest?

348111270 Good morning 
I want to get list of team in dropdown instead of ""Any""
Is it possible ? lenalevy
306816332 @sraghu-rs  - Just for my info, 
1) Do we need to add below fields in .properties file? I don't find this filed in ReadME file anywhere.
feature.queryFolder=jiraapi-queries
feature.storyQuery=story
feature.epicQuery=epic
feature.projectQuery=projectinfo
feature.memberQuery=memberinfo
feature.sprintQuery=sprintinfo
feature.teamQuery=teaminfo
feature.trendingQuery=trendinginfo

2) For Jira cloud, Team it's similar as Group or it's different? I don't find anywhere teams in jira cloud.

306899986 @meet101 @sraghu-rs pull this pr locally and test it out. I have added Any in drop down list. Type 'Any' in input field and you should be able to select. #1458 nireeshT
306932319 Thank you. Will test it and update here.  meet101
307017685 @nireeshT - I have pulled the latest code (entire Hygieia) and tested.

Below is my application.properties configuration. As mentioned, i have put 'Any' as field name in ""feature.jiraTeamFieldName""

# ST Query File Details - Required, but DO NOT MODIFY
feature.queryFolder=jiraapi-queries
feature.storyQuery=story
feature.epicQuery=epic
feature.projectQuery=projectinfo
feature.memberQuery=memberinfo
feature.sprintQuery=sprintinfo
feature.teamQuery=teaminfo
feature.trendingQuery=trendinginfo

feature.jiraTeamFieldName=Any

After running the collector jar file, now it is looking for temp-team plug in and throwing ERROR message but it is proceeding.

Is this expected behavior? 
However, now i am able to get ""Any"" as Team name and able to display the dashboard. 

Thanks for quick assist.

hygieia-jira-feature-collector is fresh 2.0.5 build from todays source code, and running in a docker container. Jira it self is a clean install, with just 3 test projects.

Cheers

307119249 @willuk2010 I am seeing the same thing in docker. Before the latest build I was able to at least pull projects. irvingwa

404's when typing in the project name, or team name boxes.. willuk2010
307124970 @sraghu-rs @willuk2010  - update to latest code, you should see the option ""Any"" when yo start typing it in input field.  nireeshT
307126485 Hey @nireeshT mine is the latest, i pulled it about an hour ago mate.

 willuk2010
307127796 @nireeshT seen as this is a platform i'm using to demo hygieia, i also just completely trashed my mongodb, and started all again fresh.. and i just cant enter anything into the Jira Project Name field, without it blanking out, none of my 3 projects are populated in the dropdown. willuk2010
307130954 @willuk2010 could you try checking if this endpoint is returning any results for you? I'm working on a customization for a feature collector based on Jira but I can't get this endpoint to work or seems I don't understand it because it returns an empty array of 'scopes' aka projects.
http://API_URL/api/scopecollector/{JiraCollector_ID}
or try the swagger if it's better to try that endpoint
http://{API_URL}/api/swagger/index.html#/scope-controller
 irvingoe
307132586 Ah, wait i only did the UI, and the Jira Collector, not the API... i have just re built and deployed the API and now i have projects in my project dropdown.

http://radiator.xxxxxxxxxxx.corp/api/scopecollector/page/59396274bfcbd80023d53f08? now returns project data.

[{""id"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f09"",""collectorId"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f08"",""pId"":""10102"",""name"":""ALMUK Support"",""projectPath"":""ALMUK Support"",""beginDate"":"""",""endDate"":"""",""changeDate"":"""",""assetState"":""Active"",""isDeleted"":""False""},{""id"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f0a"",""collectorId"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f08"",""pId"":""10103"",""name"":""Fake"",""projectPath"":""Fake"",""beginDate"":"""",""endDate"":"""",""changeDate"":"""",""assetState"":""Active"",""isDeleted"":""False""},{""id"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f0b"",""collectorId"":""59396274bfcbd80023d53f08"",""pId"":""10104"",""name"":""Will Test"",""projectPath"":""Will Test"",""beginDate"":"""",""endDate"":"""",""changeDate"":"""",""assetState"":""Active"",""isDeleted"":""False""}]

However, the team box, doesn't give me ""ANY"",  and the endpoint for that returns an empty array.

http://radiator.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.corp/api/teamcollector/page/59396274bfcbd80023d53f08?

returns []

Cheers
Will
 willuk2010
307135605 oh I see, I'm glad the projects showed up at least :P 
It seems I need to update my API as well, my UI is pointing to the endpoint without 'page' on it.
Could you just confirm me if the other endpoint is working for you?
it'll be something like this
http://radiator.xxxxxxxxxxx.corp/api/scopecollector/59396274bfcbd80023d53f08?

Thanks in advance. irvingoe
307137150 yep that endpoint works for me now.

returns,

307139083 Thanks Will! :+1:  irvingoe
307148819 No problem,

i still have the issue where Team Name box isnt populating the ""ANY"". willuk2010
307152424 I'll be working on this after I get the latest code, if I notice something that could fix the team name box issue I'll let you know :zap:  irvingoe
307166632 Cheers dude  willuk2010
307173604 @willuk2010 try ""Any"" nireeshT
307174587 @nireeshT tried that bud, but it just blanks out/removes the Any from the box. willuk2010
307175815 @willuk2010  - so when you type 'Any', it is not showing the value in dropdown to select. I have made it mandatory to select the value from dropdown. So if you just type it and not select from dropdown, it will blank out. Can you share a screen shot of what you tried to do . btw 'Any' is case-sensitive. I will fix that to ignore case-sensitivity.  nireeshT
307177248 @nireeshT that's right, if I type Any, a drop-down doesn't appear like it does with the project box.. so I can't select anything (and I guess as you suggested it then blanks the box) I'll be dialling back into work later and I'll grab a screenshot for you. willuk2010
307178499 I just fetched the latest code and @nireeshT instruction to type ""Any"" will get me this dropdown (Any got removed when I was trying to get the screenshot)

Edit: Forgot to mention I am able to select the ""Any"" item, @willuk2010  you should be able to do it as well or check the console log from your browser to see if there's any exception  irvingoe
307179648 @willuk2010  @irvingwa  what happened when you select Any with mouse cursor?  nireeshT
307180344 I was able to get the dropdown when I typed any, and now everything seems to be working. irvingwa
307181096 @irvingoe  were you able to select the value using mouse cursor  nireeshT
307181873 I was able to select it with the mouse cursor. irvingwa
307258584 Closed satishc1
307325437 Morning,

Yeh, mine does not give me a dropdown, if i enter ""Any"", no matter what.

Strange..  willuk2010
307327475 Ignore me! i deleted and re-created my dashboard, and Any is now available..

 lenalevy
351724385 Even when the property feature.jiraTeamFieldName is set to the jira Team customfield name (i.e. customfield_10616) the Team name drop down only shows Any.  This looks to be broken. nuttsky
306611063 Don't you have to populate this setting?
feature.jiraTeamFieldName=

I do remember reading something about that  irvingoe
306612302 Check this out
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/eb0dfd7532c49c8222e83a55d1f5ebf4735811ee/collectors/feature/jira/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/client/DefaultJiraClient.java#L157

you see how is looking a value in that property, otherwise it just give you an empty array of results.

```
List<Team> result = new ArrayList<>();
	    if (StringUtils.isEmpty(featureSettings.getJiraTeamFieldName())) {
	        return result;
	    }
``` irvingoe

306615024 Try to get it following the instruction in the readme file


```
 In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for ""team""
 This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
 of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's team ID field name via the following URI where your
 queried user story issue has team set on it; your custom field name describes the
 team value you expect to see:
 https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

```

I don't use Jira by the way, I just happened to dig into the code yesterday so I slightly remember the logic it is doing to get the data. irvingoe

307093362 Looks like you may need to set the correct profile to use if you are running locally
`aws.profile=default` Sbrenthughes
307259264 @golokeshpatra45 Test your credentials file by running aws ls command.  satishc1
307301730 @Sbrenthughes , I am not running it locally.
I am working on an aws instance on company account.
default profile should work then right ?
How should I choose the right profile ? golokeshpatra45
307302015 @satishc1 
Are you sure , it is aws ls ? because from the response I felt the command is incomplete . 
because going for aws ls we got this -

usage: aws [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]
To see help text, you can run:

  aws help
  aws <command> help

When a user is promoted to a dashboard 'admin', they are inadvertently promoted to an admin for the entire application. For more detail, I will define what I believe to be an 'owner' vs an 'admin'.

[],"Want to take a stab at a V2 of the API. Based on your roadmap, it looks like you wanted to create a more intelligent API, here were some thoughts I had for enhancements.

- Take advantage of Spring HATEOAS, and make the API self discoverable through use of link and proper rest nouns/verbs.  Will be more consistent and easier to navigate.

- Separate the domain model from the rest api resources.  Currently, the client needs to have more knowledge of the domain than it should have to.  Since Hygieia has been around a while now, we have a better understanding of the use cases, which should give us a better understanding of what resources we will need to expose.

- Instead of removing the old API, create a V2 we could slowly migrate to.  This would most likely be accomplished through the url.  ex. ""http:/localhost/api/v2/foo""

305680654 There is some discussion on gitter regarding some changes needed to receive ""Comcast"" contributions like Rally collector and some others they built. irvingoe
305788526 @irvingoe I believe that one involves changing Hygieia from a monolithic git project to a submodule git project, which might be a bit beyond the scope of this particular issue.

We could certainly split the API out into it's own project, though - that might make it easier for individuals to set up and make localized contributions to just the API. The same could be said about the UI - if all you want to do is make a few aesthetic improvements, you (theoretically) wouldn't have to set up a ton of stuff to make that contribution. Of course, there might be greater maintainer load associated with this approach. I think #1305 is more appropriate for these discussions :)

2. Not getting the Artifactory status on the Dashboard.
3. Are we suppose to get the Artifact deploy status on Deploy widget?

Please let me know if any additional details required.

Thank You in advance.

Regards
Manoj

At present that collection is only used by the product dashboard. As for not finding any artifacts it seems that you are not fetching any repositories. You need to be sure to set up the repositories to hit in the properties.

I am using default matching patterns:

Can you please help me tweak the pattern match.

Also is there any pattern which can search for all artifacts. Say like:
artifactory.patterns[0]=(.*)

Regards
Manoj vmanojv
307083985 That looks like it is working. Check your database - the binary_artifacts collection I believe - using a tool like robomongo.

You cannot use just .* because the collector needs to know how to extract group, module, version, etc information. That is done using named capture groups. You can create additional custom ones as needed. For example here is one that we use:

`artifactory.patterns[3]=(?<group>.+)/(?<buildnumber>\\d+)/([^/]+/)*(?<artifact>[^\\./]+)-(?<version>[^/]+)\\.(?<ext>(zip|dar))` MarkRx

[],"Hi Team,

I took the latest code from the Master branch and trying to setup LDAP. I have added the properties as given below. I do not see any errors in the api console but when I try to login thru LDAP, I get an error msg saying Invalid username and password.

auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0},OU=people,dc=xxx,dc=com

API Console:

The entire log is below but I found this line which says Dn is empty. Is that is the reason, can you please let me know what the mistake is - [localhost-startStop-1] INFO org.springframework.security.ldap.DefaultSpringSecurityContextSource -  URL 'ldap://vds.xxx.com:389', root DN is ''

395855940 @gars01 
does LDAP integration with Hygieia is working? vikramgudi89
396141930 Yes and no, I explain, I have traced the code and I have verified that the identification against LDAP is correct, however, the code tries to look for the permissions of the user and it is when it fails. Keep in mind that in my organization we do not have permissions defined in LDAP. When I trace, I see that the value of the DN attribute is null, I do not know if this is significant, nor how to assign a correct value to it, but there is no parameter to do so.
In short, the result is that no error response appears, Hygieia just does not do anything. gars01

Can anyone please help me with this issue kavitha0624
307461807 @kavitha0624 Are you using AD? satishc1
307468938 @satishc1 I did not get you.. what is AD? kavitha0624
307852949 Hi @satishc1 can you please let me know what did you mean by AD. This issue is blocking me. Please help. kavitha0624
307910025 @kavitha0624 Active Directory. The api properties for AD are different from the properties for LDAP, so if you are using AD, then make sure you set those. satishc1
308182958 @satishc1 , we are using LDAP here. So I have set the properties according to Hygieia setup document for LDAP. kavitha0624
308841997 @satishc1 , could you please suggest how do I proceed with this configuration. As you asked, we are using LDAP here. So I am guessing the properties should be correct. kavitha0624
314834993 The logs won't show the dn string you give it in the properties file, only the url.  Have you verified that user dn pattern and url outside of Hygieia to make sure it works? rob-miller-777
314835237 My best guess from what I see here is that the properties are getting through fine, but they are most likely incorrect for your ldap environment. rob-miller-777
315157688 Thanks Rob. Will check once again and update. kavitha0624
326640509 I am reviewing the LDAP code and have found some issues. I'm investigating it now. MarkRx
327571694 any updates here? Sujaydevops
328211840 No I have had to work on other things and have not had time to continue my investigation. A few things to note -

- The current implementation doesn't support LDAP binding password correctly (it is only used in the api and not the spring template)
- The current implementation lacks flexibility (i.e. custom filter)
- There are two competing LDAP libraries being used MarkRx
330583060 I'm also facing same issues with Ldap, while running api, it was not even reading Ldap properties. please help me  srujan5
330585510 @kavitha0624  did you resolved that issue, I'm also getting similar error. srujan5

387714532 I follow the rules to configure the properties file for LDAP as tutorial says, but in my case i've got the following error:

308441786 I am unsure of what you are looking for specifically but for the all the widgets besides Build and Deploy, I followed the guides for each of the collectors and for the Build and Deploy widgets I used the Hygieia-Jenkins-Plugin which does push data to the widgets. Using the data that was pushed i configured those widgets. I configured the piplelines in each team dashboard as well. Screenshots of the Build and Deploy widgets below as well as the team pipeline.

309038648 @kavalpatel15  - Throw more light on -  ""it wont properly populate the information onto the product dashboard."" Do you have issue with the commits not showing up for a specific team dashboard ? I know the above error occurs when team dashboard does not have any commits, I can fix that.

 kavalpatel15
309053958 @kavalpatel15  - I have fixed above issue in PR 1484. That occurs when your production stages did not have any commits. I see team dash ""NDC API"" is showing the commits moved to DEV, so product dash is showing the commits in environment stages. There is no prod stage , that is why the issue occurred. Set up a prod stage and you should see no of commits to prod.  nireeshT

304955484 @brennanananan and I have done some digging, and we think we have found a problem.  It looks like how this would work, is you would create an API key, which you would then use to login to receive a JWT.  We feel as though this wouldn't be an ideal pattern, you would probably want to utilize one or the other.  Here are the two options we are thinking.

1. API Key
Create an api key pretty much exactly how you are currently doing it.  Give the API key to the applications/jenkins plugins you want to access the api.  These applications would send the api key in the authorization header with each request to login.  Each time a request is sent, the api key would be checked to make sure it was still valid.  Would require some changes and new filters to work, and it is also stateful as the API now has to manage keys.

2. JWT
Modify the create token to create a JWT which you could give to an application.  The JWT would be good for a specific amount of time.  You could control at creation time the permission the JWT would have.  It would be very similar to authorization tokens Github uses. The benefits of this would be that it is similar to how the rest of the application already works, therefor wouldn't require many changes.  It is also stateless since it's a JWT. rob-miller-777
304968971 @rob-miller-777 @brennanananan 

""It looks like how this would work, is you would create an API key, which you would then use to login to receive a JWT.""  Correct.. that is the intended pattern. I've highlighted below the benefits of the pattern.. which you have already listed in your options.

1. API Key
**_Create an api key pretty much exactly how you are currently doing it. Give the API key to the applications/jenkins plugins you want to access the api.

 satishc1
304975700 How do you see this working from the jenkins plugin perspective, or anything that would want to use this pattern?  Would you give the jenkins plugin the API token, and it would login and receive a JWT each time it runs, and then use the JWT token to validate the request? Wouldn't it just be easier to send the API token with each request instead? rob-miller-777
304979272 @rob-miller-777 Thats the way I envisioned it. I went back and forth on the options you had listed  when I was creating this and settled on this pattern because it seemed to have the best of both worlds. satishc1
304980114 I'm just worried about it from a consumption perspective, I don't believe this is a common pattern.   rob-miller-777
304983156 @rob-miller-777 I only see benefits using this pattern because it fits how we are currently using it in Hygieia. The beauty of the JWT token is its stateless so we definitely want it in the picture. But we don't want to assign an indefinite expiration to it. satishc1
304984924 @rob-miller-777 Can you take this for a spin and mull it over some? I'll wait to merge this. Definitely want your opinion on this. Thanks. satishc1
304999426 I like the idea of using JWT tokens and setting an expiration of your choosing for that token.  Could make it very similar to github in being able to assign the permissions it has as well.   rob-miller-777
305000292 @rob-miller-777 Yeah, but we talked about that here https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1386 but decided against that route. satishc1
305201136 Right, I thought we had agreed on using API tokens instead of JWT.  The combination of the two is what I have a hard time getting on board with. From a consumption perspective, I would expect to be given a token which I could attach as a header to use as my authorization.  I don't think it's a good idea for a consuming app to need to make two calls to access a resource, when it really only needs to make one. rob-miller-777
305203027 @rob-miller-777 @tabladrum Ok no worries. Let me see how big of a code change it will be and then decide whether or not to merge it and refactor later. satishc1
305204892 Would be good to get some other opinions on this as well. rob-miller-777
306060464 @rob-miller-777 @MarkRx @tabladrum Changed the apitoken auth to not require a second JWT call.  The api module readme details how to create the basic auth header for secured api calls. WebSecurityConfig will need the appropriate antMatcher with the particular api end point for example
.antMatchers(""/ping"").hasAuthority(""ROLE_API"")

Which api end points to secure could be left to the users based on some api property. satishc1
306204101 Currently pretty much all gets are unsecured, and all posts require authentication besides the ones for the jenkins plugins, which we made exceptions for in the web security config.  I would say we remove the exceptions once the jenkins plugin has the ability to send an api token with the request. rob-miller-777
306207144 I'm also a little concerned about the token itself.  It looks like you are calling it basic auth, which would be username/password.  I was thinking the header would be something like,
 `Authorization: apiToken {some random guid}`.  rob-miller-777
306210625 @rob-miller-777 Correct. Once the jenkin plugin handles tokens we will circle back and clear out the TODOs in WebSecurityConfig. satishc1
306211754 Going to have to make sure to advertise that properly as it will break that interaction until people upgrade their plugin and provide an api key. rob-miller-777

[],"I'm currently using the Jenkin's Hygieia plugin to push data to the deploy widget of our team dashboard called ""01 HD Pay"" as seen below. I am using MSBuild to build the project during the integration phase.

Just to note, ""HD1"" is the integration phase, ""stage"" is the pre-production stage and ""prod"" is of course production stage. I have also set up the team dashboard's pipeline as well, so the product dashboard page should be working but isn't.

I'm unsure of what the issue is, I've seen other issues posted that are similar but have yet to find a solution. This is what the product dashboard for ""01 HD Pay"" looks like at the moment, with HD1, stage and prod empty.

Here are the plugin settings for all 3 of the Jenkins jobs, from top to bottom being HD1, then stage then prod. Has anyone experienced this issue before with MSBuild and using the Jenkin Hygieia plugin?

Do I have to run the stages HD1, stage and prod multiple times to get this up and running?

Here's what I have at the moment. I also noticed when trying to solve this issue that if your workspace has multiple Git projects within itself (i.e. There is more than one .git folder located throughout your project), there may be issues with the product dashboard detecting commits.

Also, does the repository URL you use actually work? Try making a commit to that project and running the Jenkins job to see if the new commit finds it's way to your workspace.

Can you also post what your Hygieia publisher plugin looks like for that job? Does it look like mine? ghost
308149541 Thanks.  The repository URL is still working.

 rsans
308154109 Is your workspace located on a Linux node or a Windows node? If it's a Windows node, you need \ instead of /.

Also, make sure the jobs you have for this specific pipeline which have the Hygieia publisher plugin running in all have the same Application Name but different Environment Names.

If you don't mind, please send pictures of your team dashboard, product dashboard and global Hygieia plugin settings so I can get a better grip on your problem. ghost

Artifact is generated and uploaded to nexus in BUILD stage.  Jobs named Update DevBoard only executes scripts that automates dashboard creation and updates widgets as pipeline view, monitor, etc

At dev_aws stage, the deploy application job executes a rundeck job to deploy artifact to his environment. Before this, create a dummy file with touch app-name and then execute hygieia publisher with this configuration:

308431046 Just to make sure, you have have source control management pointing to your repo for your dev_aws and test_aws jobs correct?

Each job in Jenkins needs source control management configured and pointing to that one repo.

It may also be worth checking Jenkin's console output for those specific jobs when they're run with the Hygieia publisher plugin, the response code you should be getting from it is ""201"" I believe ghost
308432543 Yes, all jobs point to the same git repository. But not master branch, each job uses the last commit id to checkout source. rsans
308434276 ""Yes, all jobs point to the same git repository."" - They also all point to the same branch though correct?

Try pushing a fresh commit to the repo to see if it shows up in the commit box, then run the build step to see it moves into the build box

If that works, then run the dev_aws step and test_aws step to see if that fresh commit is moving from box to box.

If the fresh commit stops moving at a certain stage, tell me which one
 ghost
308436705 The commit stops at build stage.

 rsans
308437175 Do you mean the commit is stuck in the commit stage (i.e. You ran the build step and the commit stayed at the commit stage), or it's made it to the build stage and can't move to the dev stage (i.e. You ran the dev_aws step and the commit stayed at the build stage)? ghost

When you run the dev_aws job, you copy the artifacts from the build step workspace to the dev_aws step workspace I presume? ghost
308460788 No, artifact is generated in build stage and uploaded to nexus. Other stages as dev_aws executes rundeck job that download artifact from nexus. For the hygieia publisher I generate a dummy object with shell script  ""touch artifact-name"" rsans

yes i have taken out at properties file and giving in ui ashu5993
309091233 @ashu5993 here are a couple of things I see

1)  Add the full path to the properties file. I would also suggest having a separate properties file for the collector
`java -jar target\github-scm-collector-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=application --spring.config.location=full_path_to_file/application.properties`
**Example:**
`java -jar target\github-scm-collector-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=github --spring.config.location=full_path_to_file/github.properties`

2) In your properties files there is no such thing as a `github.username=` so you'll need to remove that. 
3) The `github.apiKey=`is not the correct format.  See https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/UI#encryption-for-private-repos and look at the section about `Encryption for private repos` for information how to set up the github.key Sbrenthughes

[],"Currently I'm trying to integrate Hygieia in my organization's DevOps infrastructure and I'm setting up a demo to present to the teams. We currently use octopus deploy for deployment.

I'm having trouble with the Deploy widget at the moment. I am not using an Octopus collector, as that doesn't exist, but am using the Jenkins-Hygieia plugin to push data to the deploy widget as seen below.

![Deploy Widget](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16524900/26454260/9ac90376-4134-11e7-9c30-dd503a2a5541.png)

For reference, HD1 is meant to be my organization's integration environment, which builds our project. I however am having trouble for the other environments I want to add to the deploy widget, specifically our pre-production and production environments, so in the end I want the deploy widget to look like this.

The main issue is that when trying to configure the Jenkins Job for our pre-production and production environments, Hygieia still requires I choose artifacts from the workspace even though the pre-production phase only does tests on the artifacts produced from our integration phase.

Is there a way to ignore the requirement for artifacts and still publish deployment results in the pre-production and production environments as they don't produce artifacts?

Or should I just clone the artifacts from our integration phase to our pre-production and production phases so that I can designate a location for the artifacts?

1. The link in the Hygieia widget : https://bitbucket.org/username/repoName
2. In my **dashboard.properties** :

304367734 Okay I finally find out the issue, Looks like URL hard-coded is wrong for bit bucket cloud. What i have done is,
in application.properties file, I added (found from here #496)
git.host = api.bitbucket.org/
git.api = /2.0/repositories/

then i tried to run and i got again error with,
2017-05-26 19:10:01,630 ERROR c.c.d.c.DefaultBitbucketCloudClient - 400 Bad Request:https://bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/**cket.org**/awsagero/testapi/commits?sha=master&since=2017-05-26T18:58Z

1) cket.org is wrong. Also, 
2) it's still looking for host https://bitbucket.org even if i  passed api.bitbucket.org. in application.properties

I tried to browse URL **https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/awsagero/testapi/commits?sha=master&since=2017-05-26T18:54z**
and it's asking me for authentication. once i pass my credentials, It's giving me the correct output as below,

**Output i got from above URL.**
> {""pagelen"": 30, ""values"": [{""hash"": ""bf9420418f08f9bf60d902e554ebb565ea2ab79c"", ""repository"": {""links"": {""self"": {""href"": ""https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/awsagero/testapi""}, ""html"": {""href"": ""https://bitbucket.org/awsagero/testapi""}, ""avatar"": {""href"": ""https://bitbucket.org/account/awsagero/avatar/32/""}}}}, ""parents"": [], ""date"": ""2017-05-26T02:41:30+00:00"", ""message"": ""added all files\n"", ""type"": ""commit""}]}

I am thinking, team will need to find why it's adding cket.org  and taking default host name even if we pass the diff. host name by git.host.

can you guys please confirm the above troubleshooting is correct or not? Also, can you please let me know where can i do this changes to fix the URL. or can you help to fix it? @softwareklinic @tabladrum @aryasunny.  meet101

Also, I have a question regarding other collector, 
can we use code commit instead of Github collector without making any change in collector? if not, how hard is to make a collector? for source repo we are using Code commit (can move to Bit bucket, so it's already supported by Hygieia) but for Deployment we are using AWS Elastic beanstalk/codepipeline (I want to make collector for it, Any suggestion?) 

hopefully I will get this tool up and running, Great tool. so excited to get this setup in our environment.

I'm currently using Sonar for the Quality widget, and as I understand it Sonar fills in the following sections:
- Static Analysis
- Version
- Unit Tests
- Code Coverage

but you need the Jenkins Cucumber plugin to fill in the Security Analysis and Functional Tests section.

My question is if it is possible to use any other method of filling in the functional tests section as my organization doesn't use cucumber for testing (We don't currently care about the security analysis section at the moment)

304017341 Hey @irvingoe, I don't think there's formal documentation, but you can have a look at the `Feature` model here:
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/model/Feature.java

There's also a swagger UI for the API hosted here (make sure the API is running):
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger/index.html

But, it looks like there's no POST or PUT endpoint for features, so you'll have to build a collector. You can use these ones as a reference:
https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature

That should hopefully get you started. mrpudn
304151504 @mrpudn thank you for that!
And yeah I guess I could dive into swagger and get some reference from there.
I'll give it a try! irvingoe

[],"With more and more properties being added, it's getting very difficult to manage all the properties in a clean way.  We have come across multiple issues with docker properties builders, and the complexity will only get worse as more are added.  There is also an issue with redundancy, as can be seen with the mongo settings that are repeated for all the collectors, as well as the API.  @Mpluya had opened a pull request #1138 to utilize spring cloud config, which would definitely reduce the amount of redundant properties.  It could also remove the need for the docker properties builders which has a lot of complexity in the scripts.  We have been talking about this, and our ideal state would be below.

Phase 1:
Add the dependency for spring cloud config.  We could add the codebase for a spring cloud config server to Hygieia's codebase, as seen in #1138 , or we could have that outside the project all together.  We could then let the cloud config server manage all the properties, and have those loaded on startup.  

Phase 2:
Begin to shift properties from the cloud config server to an admin page on Hygieia's UI.  The end state would ideally be the cloud config server having the mongo properties, and then each collector could get the other properties from the database after connection.  This would allow you to modify things like jenkins servers, or gitlab host from the UI, instead of properties files.  This would not need to be done all at once, and could potentially be moved over in parts.  This would remove the need for the properties builder, and potentially the need for dockerfiles altogether through use of docker maven plugin configuration. 

Would appreciate some feedback and your thoughts.

","303997676 I still am in favor of putting it in the API. The purpose of an API layer is to do this very thing. Hence you will see that existing SDLC tools all have config rest endpoints within their API layers. Plus by having it in the API you can more readily interact with model changes that need to happen when a config changes. Suppose a config change requires updating existing documents. How would you do that in a separate server without rewriting the business logic?

The context root problem is easy to fix and the config server should only be accessible by the admin role. A few more config calls isn't that much of a problem and performance really is an issue just use horizontal scaling of the API and UI layers. You'll have a dependency either way - API or cloud config server.

As for docker properties (as well as command line properties) you will need a phase in period. Phase 1 could be to insert all the properties data into config objects when the collectors start that is accessible but not modifiable by the UI. After some time has passed turn on modification and remove the command line props. If the config is going to go into the database then it should be all or nothing - starting with command line properties should be removed. MarkRx
304014273 Just so we are on the same page, when we create the admin functionality for making configuration changes, I am all for those calls being in the API app.  The cloud config server is just a standalone server that reads configuration files from a git repo, and serves them up to applications asking for them. Our end goal is to have a cloud config server that manages all the configuration that won't change, such as Mongo connection settings.  Anything we want to be dynamic, Sonar servers, Jenkins servers, etc..., would be stored in the MongoDB, and modifiable and retrievable through the UI/API.   rob-miller-777
304018920 Also, we can't store the Mongo connection information inside Mongo for obvious reasons, so we would need some way to get it to the application.  I'm not saying cloud config is the only way, but it is super easy to setup, and offers some awesome functionality.  The same config server can hold the connection information for all environments of Hygieia your organization would have, and can give you the appropriate mongo info based on your spring profile.   rob-miller-777
304053182 What if we were to not include a cloud config server inside the codebase, but just added the 1 dependency necessary to the 'core' project, that would make all the apps look for a cloud collector on startup.  You would just need to pass the apps the name of the application, and uri of the config server at startup.  We could also make using the properties builder optional somehow, because you wouldn't need both.  I could get a branch out there showing what that would look like if you wanted to see it, really shouldn't be more than a couple file changes. rob-miller-777
304342773 Take a look at this.  All I did was add the cloud config dependency which will trigger spring to look for a cloud config server at startup of all the apps, if none are found it continues on normally.  I also added a condition to the properties builder to skip if a property is set so it is no longer required if you plan on utilizing cloud config.  So the only real difference here is it no looks for a cloud config server on startup, but if not found, no change. All you would have to do for the cloud config server to work is provide the `spring.application.name`, which corresponds to the properties files the config server holds. And also `spring.cloud.config.uri` if it exists anywhere besides `http://localhost:8888`, which is the default location.

303262587 @rob-miller-777 Phase 2 aligns with what we had in mind...storing the app properies in mongo and being able to control it from the admin page. Was there a reason why you want to move all properties to spring cloud config and then move them into mongo... instead of directly moving them to mongo? Why not move just the db properties to the cloud config server as phase 1? And phase 2 move the app properties to mongo. satishc1
303416203 That works as well, just thought it might be easier to move all the properties at once, and then pull the ones we can into the database.  Just don't want to have properties being set in three different places.  rob-miller-777
303465534 Yea I've wanted this for a while. I had started to build it with system properties but those got removed somewhere :). If possible see if you can create the page dynamically without tying the implementation to each collector.

As for managing the properties I would just put them into the API server. No need for yet another server that needs to be spun up. MarkRx
303538981 We have been going down the path of embedding a cloud config server into the API, however we have come across quite a few reasons why that could get messy.  

1. Context Root - The context root of the application needs to be set to ""/api"" for the UI to work properly, which would mean all the collectors would have to get their config properties from ""http://localhost:8080/api/locationToConfig"".  This is not a deal breaker, but just doesn't feel great. 

2. Security - If you want to lock down your cloud config server using a username and password, some work would have to be down to allow this to happen since the API only accepts JWT tokens, and refuses basic auth. 

3. Performance - The API is one of the heaviest hit apps in the suite already, making it the config server would only add to the load.  It could also make having multiple API's and load balancing them tricky to manage. Also, if you decide to use an external cloud config server, you would have an unused one running within your API.

4. Dependency on API - If you are starting up all the apps at the same time, the API would needed to be started first for the cloud config server to be available for all the other apps. This means all the collectors would have a dependency on the API, which they don't currently have.  

I like the idea of each component having it's own set of responsibilities, and I would rather not have the API responsible for too many things within the application. rob-miller-777
303774171 @rob-miller-777 For ""2. Security"" ...Working on a PR for basic auth...should be available soon. satishc1
303787261 Anyone have issues with us removing the docker properties builders altogether?  They are not needed using the cloud config server and it would get ugly trying to make running them conditional.   rob-miller-777
303837945 @rob-miller-777 @MarkRx  @tabladrum Could talk about it during the conf call tomorrow. If someone doesn't use the cloud config server, they might have issues if we take out the docker props. satishc1
303997676 I still am in favor of putting it in the API. The purpose of an API layer is to do this very thing. Hence you will see that existing SDLC tools all have config rest endpoints within their API layers. Plus by having it in the API you can more readily interact with model changes that need to happen when a config changes. Suppose a config change requires updating existing documents. How would you do that in a separate server without rewriting the business logic?

The context root problem is easy to fix and the config server should only be accessible by the admin role. A few more config calls isn't that much of a problem and performance really is an issue just use horizontal scaling of the API and UI layers. You'll have a dependency either way - API or cloud config server.

As for docker properties (as well as command line properties) you will need a phase in period. Phase 1 could be to insert all the properties data into config objects when the collectors start that is accessible but not modifiable by the UI. After some time has passed turn on modification and remove the command line props. If the config is going to go into the database then it should be all or nothing - starting with command line properties should be removed. MarkRx

while setting up code repo using the following options, the Save button doesn't seem to be doing anything.

Here is what I have provided as input for the widget based on your setup instructions at http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/getting_started.html

In the SCM panel, select 'git'
  b. Enter the URL: 'https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia.git' (without the quotes)
  c. Set the branch to 'master' (without the quotes)

As the other two parameters are optional, I didn't enter them.

Now if I hit 'Save', nothing happens. 

Can you please explain what is the problem here and how I can resolve it

Older version of the Hygieia (3months old code ) was working. But however the latest code from master does not seem to work.     Let me know if any issue with the setup ?

In terms of securing APIs with some sort of token do you think this is a valid approach?

When an external system wants to make a call to a secure API in hygieia, the hygieia admin could generate a JWT token for them. The input for creating the token would be some identifier (key) and an expiration date. We wouldn't store the JWT token in hygieia, but we would store the identifier and the expiration date to have a record that a JWT token was issued to the calling system.

The calling system would pass in the token in the header of their call. We would decode the token to see its component parts that would give us the identifier.

A JWT token isn't really meant to be revoked, but at some point if we do wish to revoke the token we could use the ""identifier"" to somehow block it.

301130723 I had considered using a JWT token, but I don't think that would be appropriate in this scenario.  JWT tokens are meant to have short life cycles, since they are valid until they expire, so I was thinking that we might want to take a different approach.  My thought would be to store API keys in the database, and check them on each request.  If we start to check JWT tokens to see if they have been revoked on each request, we lose the benefit of them being stateless. We could add something to the admin page to handle generating new api keys, and managing them there.  I created #1372 , nested routes, with the idea that we could really build out the admin functionality of the app.   rob-miller-777

301154440 @rob-miller-777 That looks good. Thank you. 👍  satishc1
301107494 @satishc1 Looks like the issue is that you still try to create the active directory bean even if no ldap server is provided.  You will probably have to do something similar to what I did in that config and check to see if they are provided before configuring that bean. This comes from #1374 . rob-miller-777
301107708 #1383 is the same issue.   rob-miller-777
301108730 Sorry @rob-miller-777, do I need to make a config change or will this require code changes and a new release for me to test further? murali-kpmg
301109701 You can probably hack around this by just setting the ldap url and user dn to something for now.  The ldap login obviously wouldn't work, but it should get it up and running.  

Throw this in there and see if it starts for now as a workaround.  It will require a code change to fix.
`auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://foo`
`auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0}`
 rob-miller-777
301110738 With the dummy config for ldap, api comes up. Thanks @rob-miller-777  murali-kpmg

I have done the following steps in installing Hygieia in my AWS EC2 instance - ( Ubuntu Linux flavor):

1) Downloaded the package of Hygieia and have done mvn clean install package
2) Downloaded Mongo DB and installed it with username and  pwd.
3) Went to api folder - /target/api.jar and ran the command : 

java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=<hygieialocation>/api/ --spring.config.name=dashboard.properties.
4) Went to UI folder and ran gulp serve

302433345 @agsmorodin  - Jenkins 2.34 must be compatible version for Hygieia publisher plugin. I am using 2.46.2 ,no issues. 
 Follow instructions in http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/plugin_webhook.html 
1)  ""core"" project - mvn clean install
2) ""hygieia-jenkins-plugin"" project -  mvn test 
3) ""hygieia-jenkins-plugin"" project -  mvn clean package 
get hpi file from hygieia-jenkins-plugin/target

if you see issue while build, paste console log.

 In Jira, general IssueType IDs are associated to various ""issue""
 attributes. However, there is one attribute which this collector's
 queries rely on that change between different instantiations of Jira.
 Please provide a string name reference to your instance's IssueType for
 the lowest level of Issues (e.g., ""user story"") specific to your Jira
 instance.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's IssueType Name
 listings via the following URI:  https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issuetype/
 Multiple comma-separated values can be specified.

feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story


 In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for ""sprint"" or ""timebox"" details,
 which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your
 instance of Jira. Note: You can retrieve your instance's sprint data field name
 via the following URI, and look for a package name com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint;
 your custom field name describes the values in this field:
 https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

feature.jiraSprintDataFieldName=customfield_10000


 In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for ""super story"" or ""epic"" back-end ID,
 which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
 of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's epic ID field name via the following URI where your
 queried user story issue has a super issue (e.g., epic) tied to it; your custom field name describes the
 epic value you expect to see, and is the only field that does this for a given issue:
 https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

feature.jiraEpicIdFieldName=customfield_10002


 In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for ""story points""
 This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
 of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's storypoints ID field name via the following URI where your
 queried user story issue has story points set on it; your custom field name describes the
 story points value you expect to see:
 https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

feature.jiraStoryPointsFieldName=customfield_10003


 In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for ""team""

363144314 @yakhyadabo - we have recently merged the first in a series of refactors concerning our docker setup. Please pull the latest code, run `mvn clean install docker:build` and then `docker-compose up -d` and you should have the essentials (ui, api, db) running. from there you can configure your collectors in the override file.

344928118 I have a similar issue. When I run docker-compose up -d I receive the error: repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
I receive this error on basically all the collector images. Any idea what is going wrong here?
- I used the docker-compose.yml file from the github project
- I have logged in to Docker
- I am using Docker for Windows in Linux mode pversteijnen
363144314 @yakhyadabo - we have recently merged the first in a series of refactors concerning our docker setup. Please pull the latest code, run `mvn clean install docker:build` and then `docker-compose up -d` and you should have the essentials (ui, api, db) running. from there you can configure your collectors in the override file. Please let me know if you run into issues or have feedback. We'd love to hear from you.  matthewbeasley

[],This PR adds AD support. It also allows a dashboard to be owned by multiple users. This will enable standard users to assign their dashboard to their ldap id. The process for this will be to login to hygieia with your ldap id. This will create an entry in the user_info collection. Then login to hygieia with your standard id. Then assign the ldap id as an owner of your dashboard. Eventually you'll be able to turn off standard authentication and migrate hygieia to ldap.,227152380,1374,Active directory support and administer dashboard owners.,2017-05-08 19:43:07,2018-09-18 14:39:17,closed,12,satishc1,,"300532749 @rob-miller-777 Let us think about this a little more... our initial thought was to list owners and the administrators on the RHS.

300535650 I think we should probably clarify the difference between an owner and an admin.  My thoughts would be an owner of a dashboard should have the ability to modify and delete the dashboards they are owners of.  An admin would have the same ability for every dashboard in the application, as well as controlling who other admins are, and other functionality we may want to give them in the future.  

Because of this, you would not want to integrate the admin page with the dashboard owner dialog, because they are completely different concepts.  The dashboard configuration dialog, in my opinion, should only be used to view and modify other owners of the dashboard you are looking at, having the admins incorporated as well becomes confusing because you really can't remove an admin from the RHS. rob-miller-777
300660759 @satishc1 @rob-miller-777  Both, sorry for confused the 'Admin'.  While I say 'admin', I mean the manger DN from our AD LDS service. We definitely need a manager authorization for the connection to our AD LDS service (refer to the Jenkins setting). There are many restriction settings apart from the manager DN, like we also need to set some 'Group Search Base', 'Group Search Filter' etc...

The process is like, when initially the connection to AD LDS is established, we need a manager DN with password to access the content where call a bind action. After successfully bind the manger account, we could then see the DN that we have....   Without bind the manager DN account, nothing is explored in the AD LDS servise.

300372243 @rob-miller-777 @satishc1  Regarding the connection to our AD with Admin user/password setting, this does not work for that, does it?
Where I mean the setting like we did in Jenkins.

 xpdable
300491107 @xpdable You shouldn't need an admin user/password setting. Try it setting it up based on the auth.AD properties in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/README.md
 satishc1
300503927 On the ""Administer your dashboard"" modal, I think it would be a good idea to change the wording from ""Admin"" to ""Owner"".  I got confused and thought I was controlling admins of the application itself.   rob-miller-777
300505685 @rob-miller-777  I thought about that... problem is ..on the RHS it lists the Dashboard owners and the Administrators of hygieia (who many not own that dashboard directly). satishc1
300508475 In my opinion, I don't think admins should be shown on the right side.  Only the people who are actual owners of the dashboard.  You probably shouldn't know, or care who the admins of the application are.   rob-miller-777
300508940 It will also get confusing if you try to remove an admin, because they will just keep going back to being an owner on refresh.  It would probably be a lot simpler to just show the users who are listed as owner of the dash on that modal. rob-miller-777

319489609 What version of jira? Is it a standalone enterprise jira or one hosted on the web?

See if it works if instead you do this:

> feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story MarkRx
319868823 @MarkRx  Yes, it is standalone enterprise jira v7.3.7. Indeed tried with `feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story` but no luck. vinodhkumarvm

I do have ""Task"" as my feature.jiraIssueTypeNames. I tried ""Story"" however that did not work as well (same stack trace). Moreover, I want to be able to find issues categorized as ""Task"", would they still appear even if I use ""Story""? 

I have already confirmed that the customerfield_xxxxx values are correct. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.

302744019 @vinodhkumarvm The timeout could be due to a proxy issue. ""JSONObject[""type""] not found"" may have to do with an issue in your properties file. Are you using the properties file example from https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/collectors/feature/jira? Sbrenthughes

319489609 What version of jira? Is it a standalone enterprise jira or one hosted on the web?

See if it works if instead you do this:

> feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story MarkRx
319868823 @MarkRx  Yes, it is standalone enterprise jira v7.3.7. Indeed tried with `feature.jiraIssueTypeNames=Story` but no luck. vinodhkumarvm
320234926 You can obtain a sample json using cURL:

> curl -u username:password ""https://jira.instance.com/rest/api/2/search?maxResults=2&jql=updatedDate%3E%3DstartOfMonth%28%29%20AND%20issueType%20IN%20%28Story%29%20ORDER%20BY%20updated%20ASC""

[],"Wanted to throw out some ideas to get opinions.

## Current Implementation, user ""admin"" always admin:
### Description:
""Standard"" user with username ""admin"" will always get admin privileges, so first person to create that account gets admin.
### Pros:
- Always an admin
### Cons:
- First person to create account gets admin
- Can't ever take away the admin users admin privileges
- Have to have Standard Authentication enabled to add other admins
- Solution is very hacky

## Alternate 1, first account created admin:
### Description:
The first user added to the UserInfo collection would get the admin role.
### Pros:
- Easy to enable
- Works for both Ldap or Standard
### Cons:
- If users already exist, no admin account will be created

## Alternate 2, admin account created by app on app startup if not existing
### Description:
When the application starts up, will check to see if an admin account exists, if there isn't one, one would be created.
### Pros:
- Would guarantee an admin account exists
- Works even if users already exist
### Cons:
- Would have to display admin account credentials in logs or something
- Would have to have standard login enabled

## Alternate 3, admin user account in application properties
### Description:
We could add new properties to the application properties for creating an admin account if it's not already there.
### Pros:
- Works even if users already exist
- Can always add new admins
### Cons:
- Admin account credentials in a props file
- Requires standard login enabled

## Alternate 4, next login if no admins is admin account
### Description:
If no admin accounts exist, the next account to login would get the admin role.
### Pros:
- Guarantees admin account
- Works for standard or ldap
### Cons:
- Have to check to see if admins exist on every login
- Race to see who logs in first after change made

[],"This is a proposal for a new ""Multi-team"" dashboard that acts as a normal team dashboard with N number of components. It could be implemented two ways - (1) as simply an aggregation of existing team dashboards, or (2) as a fully configurable dashboard with each dropdown/selection allowing multiple collector items.

I have had a number of requests for a dashboard view that reports on multiple components at once. The goal would be to show all of the data normally found on a team dashboard in an aggregated way. For example:
- The feature widget would be able to include multiple teams / projects at once.
- The code repo widget would show multiple lines in the graph (one for each repo) with statistics on max and average commit counts
- The build widget would show multiple lines in the graph (one for each job). Average build duration could show histograms for each day. Latest builds could be over all jobs.
- The quality widget would show statistics on all components. Some, like the code coverage metric, could use percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th,
 75th, 90th) represented in some graphical form to best show data from multiple components.
- The monitor widget could allow for logical groupings of monitors
- The deploy widget would show a union of all of the unique environments. When entering the detailed view all of the components would be shown in a list.

The pipeline widget would show all of the components (#1259)

386708098 Hello people,

Would you have any information about the implementation of this feature?

I've read some articles saying that it's on your roadmap, but I can't find information about this.

Thank you very much. ChristoferDantas

[],"This widget was skipped when changes were made to other widgets to convert them to use the uib-typeahead directive (#1049). This PR changes the deploy widget to use the typeahead mechanism. It works with or without the ""aggregateServer"" option. I also fixed an XLD bug while in here.

When aggregate servers is on it obtains data using the following algorithm:
```
        /*
         * Obtains deployment jobs using recursion when necessary. 
         * 
         * It is necessary to make additional calls when 'aggregateServers' is true since we need all like applications on different servers 
         * to be available when saving our data. To do this we compare the last item in the list from our first paged call to all subsequent data.
         * If the application name and id is the same then we keep the data in our list. Once we encounter data that is different we can cease recurision
         * since the calls are sorted.
         * 
         * Example:
         * Suppose a size of 3 is used with aggregate servers and our first REST call returns the following:
         *   Deployment A (http://deploy.instance1.com)
         *   Deployment A (http://deploy.instance2.com)
         *   Deployment B (http://deploy.instance1.com)
         *   
         * We need to make an additional rest call to see if there are any more 'Deployment B' jobs. Suppose the second REST call returns the following:
         *   Deployment B (http://deploy.instance2.com)
         *   Deployment B (http://deploy.instance3.com)
         *   Deployment C (http://deploy.instance1.com)
         *   
         * We will keep the Deployment B's returned from the REST call and ignore everything that comes after it. Since the last item in this list is different
         * than the name + id (not shown) for our original REST call we cease searching for more items.

299231091 @rob-miller-777 This looks great. Thank you for the contribution 👍 

@rob-miller-777 @MarkRx @tabladrum I noticed a few things..

- How do we create the initial admin user? Just sign up ? Create in mongo ?

- The user_info collection doesn't specify that the admin user has ROLE_ADMIN in its authorities. How is the app identifying that the admin user is indeed an admin without having the role?

- On the Manage Admins screen, looks like it doesn't let you remove the last entry from the right hand side. And if I add and remove the ""admin"" user, does it affect anything?
 satishc1
299234687 Yeah, all these issues are related and are based on your first point, how do you create the first admin user?  To have an initial admin user, there is some logic in there that ensures the ""standard"" user with username ""admin""  is always admin. [See here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1354/files#diff-714ec0af3e35cc9d1dd046a3e82efbb4)  This is a hack, and should be replaced by something better, but I didn't want to tackle that in this merge request, and it's how it currently works, so wasn't really changing anything.  So I do agree this needs to be addressed, just not sure how to handle it yet.

As far as removing admins, I don't allow you to remove the last admin because then you would be in trouble, and currently, removing the admin privilege from the ""standard"" user named ""admin"" won't have any effect as that user will always have admin privileges.    rob-miller-777

307931990 @nireeshT, @satishc1 - 
_*It would seem that the requied `key` property is never built/created in `dashboard.properties` for the running API component to ingest.*_ Do you concur? 

Looking at [properties-builder.sh](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/docker/properties-builder.sh) file for the API component, it is and _always_ has been missing a line to create a property named `key`, which would get built from an environment variable injected during `docker run` (or `docker-compose up`) and placed into `dashboard.properties` just before the container performs its command of 
```
java -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=/hygieia/dashboard.properties
```

So if it's not established during docker run-time... how else should this runtime property get into the running spring boot app? Maybe there's some hidden or missing docs that explain this. If not, then the `properties-builder.sh` needs an update, to add the line:
```
KEY=${KEY:-}
```

Without this, in the UI, if someone tries to create a GitHub repo collector that is password protected, the [rest call](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/rest/EncryptionController.java#L25) to `/encryption/{message}` will just return `""ERROR""` giving a message of _Error encrypting password_

If somehow the GitHubRepo object is created in MongoDB with an empty or null password, [this logic](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/scm/github/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/DefaultGitHubClient.java#L116)
```java
                 // decrypt password
		 String decryptedPassword = """";
		 if (repo.getPassword() != null && !repo.getPassword().isEmpty()) {
		 	try {
		 		decryptedPassword = Encryption.decryptString(
		 				repo.getPassword(), settings.getKey());
		 	} catch (EncryptionException e) {
		 		LOG.error(e.getMessage());
		 	}

I found a decent workaround for this. Spring and its [property source precedence](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) allows for it to pick up config properties from various places, including the environment. 

So, while the `key` property is not declared anywhere as a placeholder in a properties file or in the `properties-builder.sh`  (and it should be), you can inject its value into the container as an environment variable, and spring will pick it up and use it.

Example snippet from `docker-compose.override.yml`:
```yaml
hygieia-api:
  environment:
    - JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=hygieiasecret
    - AUTH_SECRET=********
    - KEY=********
```

Could really use some gap-filling in the docs to cover this option though, or to clarify the intended approach. kwhickey

297471949 @nireeshT  : I tried to modify ApiSettings.java as shown below 

    public void setKey(final String key) {
        this.key = ""############"";   (with my access token)
    }
I then built and ran api and collector . I am still seeing 404 when hitting 
https://api.github.com/repos/company/repo-name/commits?sha=master&since=2017-04-26T12:25Z. 
Also seeing the same error as @ritusingh16 when trying to add username and password . Can someone take a look at it ?

307931990 @nireeshT, @satishc1 - 
_*It would seem that the requied `key` property is never built/created in `dashboard.properties` for the running API component to ingest.*_ Do you concur? 

Looking at [properties-builder.sh](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/docker/properties-builder.sh) file for the API component, it is and _always_ has been missing a line to create a property named `key`, which would get built from an environment variable injected during `docker run` (or `docker-compose up`) and placed into `dashboard.properties` just before the container performs its command of 
```
java -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=/hygieia/dashboard.properties
```

So if it's not established during docker run-time... how else should this runtime property get into the running spring boot app? Maybe there's some hidden or missing docs that explain this. If not, then the `properties-builder.sh` needs an update, to add the line:
```
KEY=${KEY:-}
```

Without this, in the UI, if someone tries to create a GitHub repo collector that is password protected, the [rest call](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/rest/EncryptionController.java#L25) to `/encryption/{message}` will just return `""ERROR""` giving a message of _Error encrypting password_

If somehow the GitHubRepo object is created in MongoDB with an empty or null password, [this logic](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/scm/github/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/DefaultGitHubClient.java#L116)
```java
                 // decrypt password
		 String decryptedPassword = """";
		 if (repo.getPassword() != null && !repo.getPassword().isEmpty()) {
		 	try {
		 		decryptedPassword = Encryption.decryptString(
		 				repo.getPassword(), settings.getKey());
		 	} catch (EncryptionException e) {
		 		LOG.error(e.getMessage());
		 	}
		 }
```
Will continue to pass along that empty or null password, which will resulting in requests sent to `getCommits` from the repo failing.

For many people (like us), this is a blocker as individual / system username / password details would not be allowed to be committed.

[],"@nireeshT had brought up using LDAP groups to control admin users in Hygieia in #1129 .  After discussing with our team, we thought this would be a better approach as well.  This pull request would take control of admins for LDAP users outside of Hygieia, and utilize LDAP groups instead.  You will now be able to set an LDAP group as a configuration property, that contains all of Hygieia admins.  So if I have an LDAP group named ""hygieia_admins"", I would set `auth.ldapAdminGroup=hygieia_admins`.

To make this functionality work, I moved the ""roles"" property from the UserInfo collection, to the Authentication collection.  This means that currently, the UserInfo collection doesn't really do anything, but in the future it could be used to save application specific configurations such as themes.  

Admin control for standard users would still need to be controlled within the app, and there is a pull request coming for that functionality shortly.

297164097 I'm not sure about this one. If you look at other tools they all have their own internal permissions model. Some do hook up to LDAP/AD but that is optional.

This solution would not work for us. MarkRx

301168573 This is what I am contemplating...
1. For now only Github needs this check. As the collector items are user created via the UI. Others are fetched by the collectors. 
2. Potentially others may run into the same issue - if job config changes etc. I have seen this in NexusIQ too. 
3. Each collector will have full control over what error condition to capture to ""lock"" the collection for that specific collector item.
4. Will implement this for Github  for now and carry it forward one collector at a time. The UI and API wont change. 
5. Next round will be to lock down the whole collector (in the same way) when there is a global connectivity issue (say Github is down) and create a new Collector management Admin page to manage the collectors and potentially collector items from that page.

Thoughts? tabladrum
301170473 Sounds good to me.  As far as the collector management admin page, I have been thinking it would be nice to have something like this for managing things like Jenkins/Sonar servers, instead of relying on properties files which require the application to be restarted to take effect.   rob-miller-777

296691712 Was thinking about this when working on the gitlab collector, need some way to show the user that there is an error, just not sure how to do it with what's currently available. rob-miller-777
297439154 @satishc1 @rob-miller-777  - Also we may need to halt collectors when there is an error. My opinion,  we have to set a flag(or a value) to mongo and check for collector status. Use the same flag to propagate as an error in UI, code should handle to catch exception and terminate the collectors when occurred.  Thoughts? nireeshT
297451011 Here is my design suggestion:
Set a flag in collectorItem indicating a potential bad ""url"" (including bad credential). Set it to true when encounter non 200 response multiple times (configurable via properties). Unset only via UI. Also, the UI widget should indicate that the ""url"" is encountering trouble. tabladrum
297451441 Potentially can set ""enabled"" flag on the collector item to false too- the flag is there today. Only to be modified from UI.  tabladrum
297452019 I don't know about halting the collector, at least with github/gitlab, you can get errors when the user misconfigures there repo, or using a private repo without providing credentials.  This would then stop all repos from being collected.  

My suggestion:
Create a new collection for ""Dashboard Errors"", which can be populated by any of the collectors.  Then add something in the UI for displaying the dashboard errors to the user.  There are probably other cases where things fail silently that we should be displaying to the users.    rob-miller-777
297452036 While you are at it - fix one more bug too: 
The SCM widget creates duplicate collector items. Can you fix that too :-) tabladrum
297458934 @rob-miller-777 The collector should stop polling a configured scm (collectorItem) as soon as it encounters an error. We could relax this rule if we can correctly identify the type of error. For example a network error is not reason enough to stop polling, but bad credentials or bad url is reason enough. satishc1
297480837 That would be easy enough for Gitlab, as both bad credentials, and bad url would result in a 404.  Even with that, it would still be worthwhile to alert the user so they can fix the problem.  rob-miller-777
297483643 @rob-miller-777 Definitely. We can read the flag on the collectorItem and update the status of the widget. The widget currently displays the time when the last poll happened. @nireeshT is familiar with this piece. The status could be right next to it. satishc1
300366871 @satishc1 @rob-miller-777 @nireeshT 
I have done some initial POC to capture collection error and display on the widget. 
Check this branch: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/issue-1139

-Added ""error"" as a list of a new error class to collectorItem. 
-Capturing collector's client exception and adding to the error list.
-Collector properties file will have a threshold value for number of errors. When this threshold is reached, collector stops collecting for that collector item.
- In UI: widget load function will return the errors in Promise. widget.js will handle that and display a ""red dot"" next to widget heading. A tooltip will show error. Example UI is here:

If used with the right set of collectors it is a one-stop shop for tracking code quality from inception of a project to delivery. You could request @brennanananan @rob-miller-777 @MarkRx to give you more information on how their respective organizations have benefitted from using / contributing to Hygieia.

296847226 We have not done any cost benefit. It came out of DevOps strategy work. There are enough DevOps patterns available, in general, that makes a strong argument for a transparent and rapid feedback  mechanism. Hygieia addresses (tries to) this from Delivery Pipeline perspective. tabladrum

296694078 To get it to work, you need to install the Hygieia Publisher Plugin on jenkins, and have the Hygieia API running somewhere.  It doesn't matter where the API is running as long as you have the url to the api.  After the Plugin is installed and the API is up, go to ""Manage Jenkins"", and then ""Configure System"".  Go down to the Hygieia section, and put the url for the API in there.  Click ""Apply"", and then test connection to see if it can hit the API properly.  These instructions should be in the link I referenced above as well.  rob-miller-777

298985785 There is a design flaw we discovered. It's all due to some timing of data change in JIRA and data collection - certain scenarios can cause JIRA api to fail and the collector does not go back and retry to collect the data. We are working to fix it.  tabladrum

Try cleaning up your setup. Shutdown your collectors. Do a fresh build with the latest master. Run only the api (on port 8080) and see if it launches without any errors. Then run the UI and try to create an account. It that doesn't work, post your build log and api log. satishc1

295780754 Satish,
 This is how I'm planning to run the Hygieia components:

As a background, I'm trying to do a proof of case for now.

Mongo, Jira, Jenkins, Sonar, Git and their respective collectors will run in one Linux box - The UI will run in a windows box - I thought I could run the API in the Linux box too but so far I could not figure out how to configure the UI to connect to API running in a remote host.

Can you please comment if this configuration is feasible.

As the Jira server is running in the same machine as the collector, I have 
feature.jiraBaseUrl=http://localhost:8080/

Do you think this configuration is still incorrect?

 murali-kpmg
298054712 Satish, Hygieia Team,
 I would appreciate your help. I have managed to get thru quite a few configuration issues by myself.
 
 My key question is - can the UI and API run in different hosts. I have made changes to gulpfile.js to get the UI connect to API - I can signup for an account now - I see the account created in mongodb but when i try to login with the new account, it doesnt work. I see this error message in api log:

o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound - Request method 'POST' not supported

I would appreciate your help to resolve this please.
Our team thinks the product has lot of promise but we need to setup and see it for ourself to confirm.
Your help in the setup will be very much appreciated.

 can you please advise on why i cant login thru the account created (details in the update above).

298624946 @murali-kpmg  - need more information on error. Can you run the api in debug mode, collect log and paste it here. For changing to debug mode - go to -> api/logback.xml - >  root level =""DEBUG""
Re-run api.

299638183 I read thru the ticket log for #1151. I don't have any compilation issues for api.
The other ticket doesn't say conclusively if the issues were resolved.

As i said earlier, I'm able to signup for an id and I see the new id and password inserted into mongo.
But when i use the new id and password to login, I get this error.

Hygieia Team,
 Please answer the question above - I think this is not the same problem as #1151.

@tabladrum @amitmawkin : Could you please advise on this?

300915375 @murali-kpmg Your issue heading is ""Jira collector connection issues"", but your latest comments are trying to get the UI to talk to the api. Also it appears you have changed the api to run on port 8082 and your jira collector seems to be doing something with port 8080.

Try cleaning up your setup. Shutdown your collectors. Do a fresh build with the latest master. Run only the api (on port 8080) and see if it launches without any errors. Then run the UI and try to create an account. It that doesn't work, post your build log and api log. satishc1

how you configure for repo master branch with API key and enable scopes?? nurhannankhairi
294526746 This original issue is okay now...

We are now seeing an issue with the actual collector.  Having followed the instructions on how to get this working (and including the correct application.properties --- below), we seem to not be able to reach our gitlab project (which is private, but definitely accessible at the URL listed in the logs).

I have created (in the UI) an installation and configuration for our repo's master branch with an API key from my account that has both the scopes enabled:

**Gitlab API Key (scopes)**
```
Scopes￼￼
X api Access your API
￼￼X read_user Read user information
```

**application.properties**

[],"The sonarQube api /api/resources?format=json has default limit of 500 items ( https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-6584 ) which cause not all the projects are fetched. Unfortunately my target project is out of those first 500 items on the production SonarQube in the company:(

To work around , I added the desired project name on Line 38 of [DefaultSonarClient.java](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/collectors/build/sonar/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/DefaultSonarClient.java) for now :
`private static final String URL_RESOURCES = ""/api/resources?format=json&resource=MYPROJECT"";`
But, obviously it will and only will work for me if I only have this one project to be used in the dashboard.

As the limitation could not be eliminated. Could you:
1) Somehow bulk fetch ALL projects
or 
2) Add some configuration in the application properties to specify the desired project name:
like 

> sonar.project[0]=myproject1
sonar.project[1]=myproject2

306991553 @chethanbs I've provided a temp workaround in original post, you need to modify the api url to specify your used project into the url parameters. I'd like to work out some solution as describe in the post when I have time in couple of weeks. xpdable

390680838  c.c.d.collector.DefaultSonarClient - org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: while running the sonar collector with the latest version sonarQube sonar.versions[0]=6.7.1. Could you please help hameed-repository
390681070 i have added sonar.username and sonar.password in the application.property file still facing this isssue hameed-repository
294817279 try to modify DefaultSonarClient.java with this values:
 private static final String URL_RESOURCES = ""/api/components/search?qualifiers=TRK&ps=10000"";
    private static final String URL_RESOURCE_DETAILS = ""/api/measures/component?componentId=%s&metricKeys=%s"";

Then debug methods getProjects and currentCodeQuality to fix parser errors.
 rsans
294894259 I tried with URL_RESOURCES = ""/api/projects/index"" since getProjects needs a Json array. But for URL_RESOURCE_DETAILS, /api/measures/component does not return a Json array. So the collector is still not working. tinabear
295127042 Sonar 6.3 has changed api response, so you need to change more code. Try to debug methods getProjects and currentCodeQuality and you will see what you need to modify. rsans
295347290 6.3 /api/measures/component does not return some values such as ""alert_text"" ""frmt_val"" and ""version"". I am not sure if i can skip these values for CodeQuality and CodeQualityMetric. tinabear
295351994 You can add metrics to response. Just see available metrics at https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Metric+Definitions
and add what you need to sonar collector properties file. rsans
295383567 I don't worry about what metrics i can add. Just concern what data 6.3 API can return. tinabear
295603960 ....

application.properties file -> sonar.metrics properties -> add this values: alert_status,quality_gate_details

Restart hygieia sonar collector. Sonarqube 6.3 api response now returns alert_status and quality_gate_details metrics

I've made the changes I have told you in my code and it works.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1969636/25217685/2052eb2c-25a8-11e7-942c-a2286d71563e.png)

The correct way is to add a new sonar client in the collector code, if I have time I will create a new branch and a pull-request. Right now I made the changes directly to the client by default.
 rsans
296804061 I am getting the same error with SonarQube 6.3""c.c.d.collector.DefaultSonarClient - org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException: 404""
 even after adding the values alert_status,quality_gate_details to application.properties file . 
Any new updates ? Ramya126
297008953 You should modify collector code. Not only add metrics to properties file. rsans
297050103 I am also getting the same error  ( 404 ) with sonar. Can anyone summarize steps what I need to do to fix this. Thanks.  narayan1ap
297050802 @rsans  great that its working for you. 
Could you share your code changes.  narayan1ap
297077740 Anyone who has this working with SonarQube 6.3, could you post your getProjects method?  I am working on a solution but Java this locked down isn't my strong suit.  Thank you! jessepiccolo
297085411 If you use /api/projects/index for URL_RESOURCES, project list can be fetched from 6.3 without changing code. But measures cannot be parsed. You have to change a lot with the method currentCodeQuality to parse json message from 6.3 API. tinabear
297090192 Let me take a look at the sonar 6.3 apis today and post back with details. tabladrum
297121395 This can probably be written better, but here is a quick hack to fix getProjects method.
`    
@Override
    public List<SonarProject> getProjects(String instanceUrl) {
        List<SonarProject> projects = new ArrayList<>();
        String url = instanceUrl + URL_RESOURCES;

        try {
            JSONObject jsonArray = parseAsObject(url);
            JSONArray otherArray = (JSONArray)jsonArray.get(""components"");

            for (Object obj : otherArray) {
                JSONObject prjData = (JSONObject) obj;

                SonarProject project = new SonarProject();
                project.setInstanceUrl(instanceUrl);
                project.setProjectId(str(prjData, ID));
                project.setProjectName(str(prjData, NAME));
                projects.add(project);
            }

        } catch (ParseException e) {
            LOG.error(""Could not parse response from: "" + url, e);
        } catch (RestClientException rce) {
            LOG.error(rce);
        }

        return projects;
    }

    private JSONObject parseAsObject(String url) throws ParseException {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = rest.exchange(url, HttpMethod.GET, this.httpHeaders, String.class);
        return (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(response.getBody());
    }
` jessepiccolo
297965394 getProjects works but currentCodeQuality not working.  Anyone has this working ?  narayan1ap
297968208 I'm sorry. I have no time but I will share here code changes that worked for me. But keep in mind that best solution is to implement a new SonarClient.

We are using sonar 6.2, please advice? sathishbob
312857326 @sathishbob i gave up trying to get it working with 6.2, i ended up upgrading to 6.3.

Cheers
 willuk2010
326697321 @willuk2010  @sathishbob I'm also on 6.2 finally figured out how to get it to work. Simple fix that boils down to a communication issue with Hygieia's guides.  https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1704 htvan1
332299193 Tracking this with related issue #1704.

293977928 Also I ran below command to run collector from command prompt and Same output as above

java -jar jira-feature-collector.jar -
-spring.config.location=file:///C:/Hygieia/collectors/feature/jira/application.p
roperties bhuranideepak82
294240096 Did you build core and api first?

How are you launching the application? Are you setting the path to the application properties file? 
 MarkRx
294243761 @markrx @satishc1 

Yes i did build at root level. I ran it through eclipse and command line both.

Here is the command which gives the same error.

java -jar jira-feature-collector.jar -
-spring.config.location=file:///C:/Hygieia/collectors/feature/jira/application.p
roperties

To resolve above issue, I added below dependency in POM then it gives some other dependency error.

groupId>com.atlassian.event
atlassian-event
3.0.0

 bhuranideepak82
294490172 @MarkRx  @satishc1 
I was right. There was some dependency issue. I deleted .m2 folder and built again and my JIRA collectors runs just fine. Will test to see if data is coming or not and then close it.

Thanks for your help. bhuranideepak82
293920475 @bhuranideepak82 The properties file is not read during the build. Its read when you run the jira collector. Were you able to build the hygieia project sucessfully? Can you post the output of ""mvn clean package install"" from the root of hygieia. satishc1
293921529 @satishc1 

Yes build is fine.

I am getting error while running JIRA collector.

I am getting below errors while running

com.atlassian.jira.rest.client.internal.async.AsynchronousJiraRestClientFactory.createWithBasicHttpAuthentication(AsynchronousJiraRestClientFactory.java:42) ~[jira-rest-java-client-core-3.0.0.jar:na]

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.atlassian.event.api.EventPublisher

Looks like some dependency issues. Any clue? bhuranideepak82
293927909 @bhuranideepak82 paste the command you used to start up the jira collector and the resulting log. satishc1
293928585 @satishc1 
I am running from eclipse right now. Please note Jenkin and Bitbucket worked fine for me.

Below is the error I get when i run jira collector.

The recommendation is create a separate collection called gitmetadata.  This will be updated from GitHubCollectorTask. This is similar to gitrequests which contains pulls and issues and is updated from GitHubCollectorTask.

You can store repo level information inside the gitmetadata collection. Things you could choose to store in here includes branches, last time a branch was updated, releases, commits, contributors etc. The screenshots below show what could be captured.

300391917 Hello! I'm new to Hygieia and currently attempting to create a custom collector. I have gone through various articles on the same but weren't of much help on the beginner level. It would be invaluable for me if could extend any advice or sample projects on how you got your custom collector working. Also the current code flow so I could conveniently get started .@smsuresh  @nireeshT 
Thank You! monabhardwaj

[],"I have read the code to calculate the average time of code commit in each pipeline stage.
![average time](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24744685/7493817e-1ae5-11e7-8f86-e7eef3a063b7.png)
The code is between line 114 and 182 in js file UI\src\components\widgets\product\js\commit-data.js.
For example, in order to calculate the average time of Commit stage, it will calculate the time intervals of  Commit stage -> Prod stage, Commit stage-> QA stage, Commit stage -> DEV stage, Commit stage-> BUILD stage, and it will calculate the time intervals of all the code commit time to now in Commit pipeline stage, then calculate the average of all the time intervals, is this reasonable？ why?

Another issue, I think when calculate the average time of each pipeline stage, the order of all the stages should be Commit, Build, DEV, QA, Prod, but when I debug the code, the order is Build, Commit ~~~, the first one should be Commit not Build. 
![order](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24745541/a1e20c7e-1ae8-11e7-9160-ae34c13fbf2b.png)

292179229 @wdquan1985  - Order of stages in above code is irrelevant in above code because we maintain order of stages separately and that order is used for display on product dashboard.  nireeshT
292388785 @nireeshT - I create another team level dashboad with the same data as above but without deployment pipeline configured, add this new team dashboard to the product dashboard, the stages order is Commit, Build not Build, Commit.
![two stages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24781598/5646c54e-1b73-11e7-8c05-80b5e877621d.png)

And the average time for Commit and  Build stages in the two team dashboard is different, but from the code above, they should be different.
![different](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24781630/8f435bdc-1b73-11e7-8ba4-268485cabc17.png)
 

 wdquan1985
292418268 @nireeshT - The dynamic pipeline code had been changed.
I use an example to show the change, we have three code commits 1, 2, 3, commit 1 has been deploied, commit 2 has been build.
Before the dynamic pipeline code change, pipeline will show as following.
![way 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24784316/3db82796-1b84-11e7-9280-b95d6191bda7.png)

But after the code change, pipeline will show as following.
![way 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15209842/24784321/4e184a58-1b84-11e7-8bbc-9c83f0d376fb.png)

The dynamic pipeline code has been changed, but the average time code not, is there any mismatch? wdquan1985
292551850 @wdquan1985  we do not go with the order shown above as the list will not guarantee the order of elements, so order is maintained separately in different object from Mongo. I am looking in to dynamic pipeline, looks like it need a fix or may be not. Will let you know.  nireeshT

316853927 @nireeshT  hi niresht  i would like to know how data is proccessed from the api to the ui . i have to customize the sonar widget and the api to display the history of several analysis . thank you for your help in advance . marrwa
331976819 @marrwa :  for UI code, you can refer to code under Hygieia/UI and similarly for api, you can refer to code under: Hygieia/api. UI makes REST calls to API to get the processed data.  nitin1706
291892444 hi marwa i have also the same problem please if you get any answer let me know  omarmahmoudi
291897167 @marrwa  @omarmahmoudi  - maven version ? upgrade to latest and try mvn clean install on Hygieia. nireeshT
292098473 my maven version is 3.1.0 
should i upgrade it to maven 4 ? marrwa

292179882 @marrwa @omarmahmoudi  are you using mvn clean install or mvn clean install package . Use mvn clean install nireeshT
292180258 @nireeshT  i've used mvn clean install  marrwa
292612967 @marrwa @omarmahmoudi  - 
1) Which java version used ? use java 8. 
2) try deleting full .m2 local repository and rebuild. 
3) if still issue run -> mvn clean install -X to find root cause  nireeshT
292905875 @nireeshT do u know please how to connect to the hygieia api? which login and password should i put ? marrwa
292944145 @marrwa - run api from target folder with below command 

java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties

For dashboard.properties file refer https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/tree/master/api - README.md

From UI folder -> gulp serve 

Once Hygieia is launched on localhost, you can sign up users 

 nireeshT

 marrwa
293516001 @nireeshT  where can i find plz the dashboard.properties file ?? should i create it somewhere ? marrwa
293577633 @marrwa create dashboard.properties in any location and reference the same location in below command to run api 
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=<location>/dashboard.properties
or 
create dashboard.properties and drop it in your api project and run below command. 
java -jar api.jar --spring.config.location=dashboard.properties

`java -Jar hudson-collector.jar` and i see that i'm unable to access to this jar file .
where can i find it please ?? marrwa
294869173 @marrwa  - 
1)  run mvn clean install on root Hygieia
2) go to target folder of  Hygieia/collectors/build/jenkins/ target/ and run that command. Make sure that jar file is present in that folder ( or change name of hudson-collector.jar in your command to whatever it is in that location). 
3) Create a properties file for Hudson/Jenkins collector, place it in local and refer the same location in below command from target folder 
java -jar jarfilename.jar --spring.config.location=location you copied/jenkins.properties

Refer this link for sample jenkins properties : http://www.capitalone.io/Hygieia/jenkinsbuild_collector.html 

Do similar steps for all the collectors, create different properties for each collector. I prefer to copy all prop files in same location and refer them in run command. 
Refer : https://developer.capitalone.com/opensource-projects/hygieia/

` Exception encountered during context initialization - cancelling refresh attempt org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'hudsonCollectorTask': Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException`
 
and when i search from the internet i understand  that this is a  problem with Spring and Jackson versions? should i downgrade the spring version or this is not the real cause ?? marrwa
294900133 @marrwa  use this command 

java -jar jenkins-build-collector-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=location you copied/jenkins.properties nireeshT

331976819 @marrwa :  for UI code, you can refer to code under Hygieia/UI and similarly for api, you can refer to code under: Hygieia/api. UI makes REST calls to API to get the processed data.  nitin1706

[],"With the amount of potential tools available to integrate with Hygieia, it will probably be very difficult to manage at some point.  Have you guys given any thought to creating some sort of plugin architecture for Hygieia for adding new tools.  For instance, instead of having Gitlab, Github, SVN and Bitbucket available by default as SCM collectors, don't have any available until you ""install"" the plugin for the tool, however that may look.  I know it would be a significant effort, but it might be worth thinking about with all the potential tools available for integration.

292595435 I like the idea too @amitmawkin @satishc1 @MarkRx  tabladrum
292604455 The only complaint I have with this approach is conflicts. If one plugin works on it's own but not with others or a combination thereof, it begins to get messy doing the cleanup afterwards which often never ends, and requires exponentially more tests to automate. SO as I do agree there would be benefit from a plugin architecture, the goal of any plugin should be to be fully integrated into the stable base as a feature. GNU is Not Unix.  swizzley
292613467 That's fair, our concern comes from the fact that we have some homegrown tooling that we would like to incorporate into Hygieia.  So obviously we wouldn't contribute collectors/UI changes back for these, since they wouldn't make sense outside our company. So that would leave us with a couple options, fork the repo, and make our specific changes to our fork. Or if plugins were possible, we could just write plugins for our custom stuff.    rob-miller-777

This PR enhances the monitor widget in three different ways:
* **UI Side**
  * It adds a new icon to denote services explicitly as unauthorized (this icon is a lock, and it is green due to the fact that in order to get the unauthorized the service must be on and running)
  * It adds a legend for quick explanations of what the different icons mean
* **API Side**
  * It adds support to apply proxy credentials via the API properties file to allow the ServiceService to ping endpoints outside of the proxy.

**Also Included**
* Slight refactor of how service health checks are made to make it more testable.
* Dashboard ID is passed to layer where call is being made - this ensures more informative logging around which dashboard is having connectivity issues and/or which dashboard is pinging endpoints it possibly should not be pinging.

291572096 @nireeshT Thank you. Will try that. I believe after setting Publish artifact information, a build/deploy job needs to triggered to invoke the plugin to collect the data, am I right? Or does the plugin collects the data automatically after the settings are saved in the ui? alagus84

How much interest would there be for an enhancement to Hygieia that would enable collectors to send the data they collect to a configurable endpoint (e.g REST) in addition to going to MongoDB?  I was thinking this destination endpoint would be configured per collector.  The endpoint would be optional, so it is only executed if it is configured.

","289787367 @ceytalis What will be the role of the endpoint? Is it used by Hygieia in any way or is it some analytical tool ? satishc1
289827334 @satishc1 I saw the role of the endpoint as a way to share the data collection event preformed by Hygieia with systems external to Hygieia.  It is a notification that a particular data collection event took place and here is the data that was collected.  The system behind the endpoint could then do whatever it wants with the notification and data. ceytalis

[],"I have spent the good part of the last two weeks playing around with the Jenkins Publisher.  It has been a bit of a struggle trying to figure out why I couldn't get commits to move from the build phase, to any of my environments, but I think I finally tracked it down.  The issue seems to stem from a recent change made for the dynamic pipeline.  (Sidenote, what is the need for having the standard pipeline, and the dynamic pipeline, and which should I be using?) I am currently using the standard pipeline.  The major problem seems to be when I have changes in the build env, and I run the deploy publisher, it tries to match to artifacts with the same artifact name and extension.  However, a recent change was made to the [DeployBuilder](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/commit/737e14e2354a9d1a0d70354e2b9c5ef488bc7eff) which pulls the version and extension out of the artifact name, instead of just the version.  This means that an artifact containing a change set will never match up to the environment, as the extension is always null, stranding the change sets in the build env forever.  Has anyone else encountered this issue?

289248889 Boils down to difference between these two methods:
```
    public static String determineArtifactName(FilePath file, String version) {
    	String fileName = file.getBaseName();
    	
        if ("""".equals(version)) return fileName;

        int vIndex = fileName.indexOf(version);
        if (vIndex <= 0) return fileName;
        if ((fileName.charAt(vIndex - 1) == '-') || (fileName.charAt(vIndex - 1) == '_')) {
            vIndex = vIndex - 1;
        }
        return fileName.substring(0, vIndex);
    }

    public static String getFileNameMinusVersion(FilePath file, String version) {
        String ext = FilenameUtils.getExtension(file.getName());
        if ("""".equals(version)) return file.getName();

        int vIndex = file.getName().indexOf(version);
        if (vIndex <= 0) return file.getName();
        if ((file.getName().charAt(vIndex - 1) == '-') || (file.getName().charAt(vIndex - 1) == '_')) {

        }
        return file.getName().substring(0, vIndex) + ""."" + ext;
    }
```
The first one does not seem to return the ext of the file. Not sure yet.
@rob-miller-777 Can you quickly change the following code in Deploybuilder  locally and test:
```
String artifactName = HygieiaUtils.determineArtifactName(f, artifactVersion);
```
to
```
String artifactName = HygieiaUtils.getFileNameMinusVersion(f, artifactVersion);
```

289248938 @nireeshT @satishc1 FYI... if you can check too. tabladrum
289492751 Had to do that, in combination with flipping two lines in the EnvironmentComponentEventListener class.  It is currently:
```java
artifactName = artifactName.substring(0, dotIdx);
artifactExtension = artifactName.substring(dotIdx);
```
Changed it to: 
```java
artifactExtension = artifactName.substring(dotIdx + 1);
artifactName = artifactName.substring(0, dotIdx);
```
The artifact extension was always null because it had already been removed.  I also increased the index to remove the period prefix.

289578199 Is it the responsibility of the angular app, or the api to filter out the commits per stage? rob-miller-777
289578265 I'm having a difficult time figuring out where that occurs. rob-miller-777
289592121 Looks like there was a [commit](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/commit/a822796fe738b52a92f199192143510f462ec106) a month ago that removes removes filtering out commits when they are in later stages. I'm assuming this logic would have been moved to the UI, but can't find it. rob-miller-777
289605088 We are looking into it right now.  tabladrum
289763460 The dynamic pipeline is an incomplete POC that I will get back to in the near future. It's purpose is to correlate data on hand dynamically instead of doing so when the data is collected as that has a number of shortcomings https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/804#issuecomment-247391585.

```
        	artifactName = artifactName.substring(0, dotIdx);
        	artifactExtension = artifactName.substring(dotIdx);
```
Ha good catch. Looks like I wrote that too.

In regards to commits showing up in each stage - actually I think I prefer that. If a commit makes it to A, B, and C I as a user would want to see it in A, B, and C. Otherwise, as a number of people have brought up, some stages will appear to be empty with no data and this is confusing.

> HygieiaUtils.determineArtifactName

The logic looks correct. It assumes a format of 

> artifactname[[-_]version][.ext]

. The artifactName corresponds to the standard maven/ivy concept of an artifact name. This was changed with #913 and #983. Before that artifactName was defined as name + extension (from getFileNameMinusVersion).

With the correction from @rob-miller-777 it should work as intended. In the past the old Jenkins plugin would define artifact name as artifact name + extension (from getFileNameMinusVersion). If the listener could not find data and it detects a file extension in the artifactName (implying the old jenkins plugin was used) it will revert back to using the old method thereby allowing it to work with data from the old Jenkins plugin:

```
-            artifacts = binaryArtifactRepository.findByArtifactNameAndTimestampGreaterThan(environmentComponent.getComponentName(), lastArtifactTimestamp);
+            artifacts.addAll(Lists.newArrayList(binaryArtifactRepository.findByArtifactNameAndArtifactExtensionAndTimestampGreaterThan(artifactName, artifactExtension, lastArtifactTimestamp)));
+            
+            // Backwards compatibility
+            if (artifactExtension != null) {
+	        	// In the past the extension was saved as part of the artifact name
+	            artifacts.addAll(Lists.newArrayList(binaryArtifactRepository.findByArtifactNameAndArtifactExtensionAndTimestampGreaterThan(environmentComponent.getComponentName(), null, lastArtifactTimestamp)));
+            }
``` MarkRx
289766549 @rob-miller-777  I think I found the issue with the stage commits not vanishing in before stages. Working on it now.  nireeshT
289766555 As far as the the commits that have moved to a further stage, I'm cool with them being visible in each stage, but maybe have some way to differentiate it. Maybe show a greyed out box for the ones that have already moved on?  Currently, you just see them all as if they are all still in that stage. 

The issue with the determine artifact name is that later on, you need the artifact extension, and this method is throwing it away. The logic works correctly to get the file name, just doesn't put the extension back on. rob-miller-777
289767348 ~Is DeployBuilder.java missing this (from ArtifactBuilder)?~

```
bac.setArtifactModule(artifactName); // for now assume maven artifact
bac.setArtifactExtension(FilenameUtils.getExtension(f.getName()));
```

Actually there might be more to it. I remember coming across this and finding it to be finicky. The deploy service ""artifactName"" is a misnomer. Instead it refers to the name of the component that the deploy collector deployed which may or may not be the same. The search in the environment_component repo is being done off of this component name. Depending on how you setup Jenkins / UDeploy / XLD will determine whether or not the current logic works for you. It could use a little attention I suppose. MarkRx
289769437 Yeah, the deploy request object doesn't even have an artifact extension property. rob-miller-777
289769528 See my updated comment MarkRx
289770769 1. I am adding those.
2. Commit movement: Working to get it back to where it was - i.e moving them from one stage to another. Then will discuss if there is a better way. tabladrum
289778885 I take that back. 
EnvironmentComponent model has a generic componentName. 
It is set to ArtifactName. It should contain the extension.
If we incorporate @rob-miller-777 's suggested corrections, we should be good. 
@rob-miller-777 let me know if you want to do the PR or want us to do it. 
I do however need to correct the code in DeployBuilder to set it to the way it was before. tabladrum
289779727 You guys can take care of it, you know more about the pipeline than I do.   rob-miller-777

[],"I see that the Jenkins build collector makes a rest call to Jenkins to get the instance jobs and returns the response json object with either the job or build details.

289185032 I did configure the deploy job, but I will go back check if the configuration was correct or if I missed anything.
I am slightly confused when you said hygieialistener will push build and deploy data to mongodb.

I see following activity is done by Jenkins-build-collector
1. Hit mongodb to verify if the collector is present in the collector repository
2. Make a rest call to Get job count and the instance jobs from Jenkins by making recursive calls Jenkins, provided if there are subjobs
3. Hit Mongodb to get all the existing build jobs
4. Filter new jobs by comparing results from step 2 & 3
5. Add new job and build details to Mongo db

So from the above step, I see Jenkins build collector collects the job and build data from Jenkins and pushes it to mongo db

Following is what I see happening in Jenkins hygieia plugin
1) HygieiaListener has a lifecycle methods onstarted and oncompleted. onstarted publishes build data and oncompleted publishes build, artifact, sonar, test results, and deploy data
2) publish build data makes a rest call to jenkins and publishes build information and publish deploy data makes a rest call to Jenkins to retrieve and publish deploy information


First question is what is this listener configured to listen to?
Second question, to whom are they publishing this information to?
Thirdly, If Jenkins build collector retrieves the job and build data from Jenkins, reconciles and pushes the new job and build data to mongo db, what is the need to have a hygieia listener.

Again I am sorry if I am confusing you, but I am trying to understand the very existence of hygieialistener and the duties it does. Probably if my above 3 question were answered, that would shed me some light to proceed further. Thanks for your help alagus84
289451789 @alagus84  - Hygieia publisher plugin configuration does collect build data and deploy data if you configure in jenkins job as mentioned in screenshot. Two ways you can collect build data - either by using Jenkins build collector or by configuring Hygieia publisher plugin in Jenkins job like screenshot above( use either one way but not both). I am assuming you are using Hygieia publisher plugin, your second post said otherwise. 
Deploy data  can be collected - either using uDeploy collector or by configuring Hygieia publisher plugin(use either one). if you want to collect build and deploy data separately with different collectors, use Jenkins-build collector and uDeploy collector but not Hygieia publisher plugin.  nireeshT

I am hitting below error while trying to get projects data:

# via the following URI, and look for a package name <em>com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint</em>;

289550392 It's a bug in the code that is causing an Exception that is causing the real problem to get lost.

```
			} catch (RestClientException e) {
				if (e.getStatusCode().get() != null && e.getStatusCode().get() == 401 ) {
```

needs to be 

```

Provided is an automated UI test suite using Serenity and jBehave. 

The solution has been dockerized for ease of injecting data and ensuring proper setup and tear down. (credit to @brennanananan)

* Tests can be run either locally or as a continuous integration step. (See readme for setup instructions).
* Test reports can be found in ${UI-tests}/target/site/serenity/index.html after the test suite has finished executing.
* Test data can be pre-inserted to the mongodb through the mongo_setup.js
* You may select your target webdriver based on the Selenium node image you choose.
* You are able to run tests on a UI deployed on an SSL server.

A note on completeness:
* This is merely a foundation for building a more robust UI test suite. It is out of the scope of this pull request to include tests for every feature of this product.
* As more features are developed, it will be easy for the contributor to add automated UI tests.",216591542,1264,UI tests,2017-03-23 22:28:25,2018-09-18 14:39:07,closed,8,GabrielFabian,,"296674484  @brennanananan Thanks, I changed my Mozilla firefox browser version from 52 to 30. Now the UI-Tests run succesfully with the command : mvn clean install -DUITEST_EXISTING_USERNAME=hygieia_test_user -DUITEST_EXISTING_PASSWORD=password.

 As im not using docker, is there any option to cleanup the test data from mongodb once the test run is completed doraemon0011
296696228 @doraemon0011 Currently there is no way to easily clean up the database inside the UI test execution. The reason we preferred to use the docker solution was so that we could perform whatever operations on the database that we needed, and then simply stop the container at the end. In that scenario, cleanup is not needed as the data is never persisted outside of the container. brennanananan
315230135 @GabrielFabian I am seeing the following error when I try to build the project.

```[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.spotify:docker-maven-plugin:0.4.10:build (docker) on project ui-tests: Exception caught: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.spotify.docker.client.shaded.javax.ws.rs.ProcessingException: java.io.IOException: No such file or directory -> [Help 1]```

If I comment the docker-maven-plugin spotify in UI-tests/pom.xml, project builds without any issues.  kumarvarun1252

I am able to run tests with the following command in the `UI-tests` folder
`mvn clean verify -f ./docker-pom.xml -DUITEST_EXISTING_USERNAME=hygieia_test_user -DUITEST_EXISTING_PASSWORD=password`

Tests will fail because of some changes to the UI. I have the fixes locally which I can submit once this PR is merged to master.

296674484  @brennanananan Thanks, I changed my Mozilla firefox browser version from 52 to 30. Now the UI-Tests run succesfully with the command : mvn clean install -DUITEST_EXISTING_USERNAME=hygieia_test_user -DUITEST_EXISTING_PASSWORD=password.

 As im not using docker, is there any option to cleanup the test data from mongodb once the test run is completed doraemon0011
296696228 @doraemon0011 Currently there is no way to easily clean up the database inside the UI test execution. The reason we preferred to use the docker solution was so that we could perform whatever operations on the database that we needed, and then simply stop the container at the end. In that scenario, cleanup is not needed as the data is never persisted outside of the container. brennanananan

I am able to run tests with the following command in the `UI-tests` folder
`mvn clean verify -f ./docker-pom.xml -DUITEST_EXISTING_USERNAME=hygieia_test_user -DUITEST_EXISTING_PASSWORD=password`

Tests will fail because of some changes to the UI. I have the fixes locally which I can submit once this PR is merged to master.

288720822 @Satheesh-b  -  make sure you give environment name in Hygieia publisher settings. Environment value is what displayed in deploy widget for the selected deploy job. Make sure Application name remains same for all the deploy jobs in different environments. Refer screenshot.

288948871 @nireeshT thanks for the prompt reply. But where we are supposed to give the deployment environment URL(IP address) for each environment. How the plugin fetches the data from each environment without the URL?

Currently, my plugin returns environment URL which is as same of the Jenkins URL(Referred from environment_components table). It should point to each deployment environment URL. I would like to know where I should give the environment URL in the configuration for each environment.  Satheesh-b
289218385 Im also having a similar issue. Jenkins plugin is deployed, configured and connect to Hygieia successfully. I then integrated the hygieia pipeline steps within my groovy script. Here is my example for deploy step:

`hygieiaDeployPublishStep applicationName: 'App name', artifactDirectory: 'app/target', artifactGroup: 'com.yourcompany.product1', artifactName: '*.jar', artifactVersion: '0.0.1', buildStatus: 'Success', environmentName: 'DEV'`

The pipeline finishes/passes but I'm not gettng a dropdown in the Hygieia deploy widget.  celamb4
289451181 @Satheesh-b Please follow the steps listed in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/hygieia-jenkins-plugin/README.md on how to configure the plugin.
And follow steps listed in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/884 on how to configure your deployment jobs.
The hygieia plugin does not need to know any information about ""deployment environment URL(IP address) for each environment"" . Your jenkins deploy job takes care of that based on what you specify for the deploy and the post build step tells Hygieia about a ""successful"" deployment.

 satishc1
289453249 @Satheesh-b @celamb4   - Reopen if issue not resolved.  nireeshT
289488208 @satishc1 
Thanks for your reply. I have successfully configured the plugin and able to get the information from local jenkins. But our actual requirement is to display the deployment information for an application which resides in a remote server.

How can I monitor an application deployed via jenkins into a remote server? In that case what would be the artifact directory? Satheesh-b
289502753 @Satheesh-b You can ""monitor"" a url using the monitor widget.

The artifact directory is on the jenkins server that builds the artifact. Your deployment job needs to have steps (eg.shell, pipeline etc) in the deploy job to ""send"" the artifact to the environment in question. The hygieia plugin doesn't monitor the artifact end location. satishc1
289543467 @satishc1 Thank you for your reply. Just went over #884 not sure if I'm missing something since I'm still missing the data in the UI.

1. Hygieia jenkins plugin is configured and connects to hygieia api.
2. In my pipeline. I have added all steps from the hygieia plugin in their respected locations. For example, buildstatus, aritfact, deploy, etc.
3. I then go to the hygieia UI --> deploy widget but dont have any apps listed.

Here is the example of my hygieia deploy step in the jenkins pipeline.

`hygieiaDeployPublishStep applicationName: 'App name', artifactDirectory: 'app/target', artifactGroup: 'com.yourcompany.product1', artifactName: '*.jar', artifactVersion: '0.0.1', buildStatus: 'Success', environmentName: 'DEV'`

Thanks again! celamb4
289552721 @celamb4 Assuming your artifact is being generated inside $yourjenkinsworkspace/app/target Try changing artifactDirectory: 'app/target'  to be artifactDirectory: '/app/target' 

Verify that you have a jar file inside $yourjenkinsworkspace/app/target 

Try that and if still an issue, please post your jenkins job log. satishc1
289559382 artifactDirectory: '/app/target'

378718192 @syedsfayaz Try changing the buildStatus : ""Failure"" in hygieiaDeployPublishStep, if you have a condition to check the status of your deployment in pipeline and it reports that the deployment doesn't happen due to any reason.  Satheesh-Balachandran
378738541 @Satheesh-b @nireeshT I was trying to manually modify the status and i see this error. ( do we have any status apart from passed and failed)

[],"Hello,

Can we deploy UI in microsoft IIS? I've created a website pointing to dist directory and started API component in 8888 port in same server. 
I am able to launch UI in browser but it is not connecting to API module. Tried url redirect and other ways in IIS to redirect :3000/api to :8888/api, still no luck.

Please help understand building/deploying UI component to work in IIS.

Thanks and Regards,

","288424886 I configured it in dashboard.properties but not in application.properties. Do we need to override in both places? srinivas-n4u

288832024 @srinivas-n4u  - change the log level to DEBUG and run api and paste app log here.

288385285 @wdquan1985  - you configured pipeline widget with custom stage names ?  nireeshT

Is there anything wrong in my application? 
 wdquan1985
288628241  @nireeshT - additional information to explain, I have not configured deployment widget, but I don't think it should affect the other stage, such as commit and build. 
And I add a configuration ""feature.dynamicPipeline=enabled"" in application.properties for api, so when request for pipeline info, it use dynamic pipeline service, and the value of property orderMap will not be set when build pipeline response, but this property will be used in the product level dash to show all the pipeline stages, so there is no any stage shown. wdquan1985
288717939 @wdquan1985  - remove  ""feature.dynamicPipeline=enabled"" and re run api. You should see COMMIT and BUILD. nireeshT
288761974 In order for the dynamic pipeline to work your git repo url must match what jenkins is reporting it is using. The branch must match as well. Turning on debug in the API should show you what is going on. MarkRx
288962401 @nireeshT , @MarkRx , I add the following code to the method buildPipelineResponse of DynamicPipelineServiceImpl.java file, it can work now.
        _pipelineResponse.setProdStage(PipelineUtils.getProdStage(dashboard));

The dynamic pipeline service will be disabled in future? I think it's better than the pipeline service. wdquan1985

Our plan is to write a new collector that addresses our needs (we want to track deployment of artifacts across the stages, not commits across the stages). We hope to release this collector back to the community if it works for our needs, in case it might more accurately reflect someone else's deployment strategy. Thank you very much for your help and time. :) ciscoemp

307778280 @nireeshT I have updated to the latest code base. but still I have the same issue.

I have my stages in the pipeline table with commit field as empty. I am confused why does the EnvironmentComponentEventListener is not pushing the data to pipeline.

To elaborate in brief, I am pushing the data from hygieia jenkins plugin into the environment component table and also it is multi component. Every thing is fine for the deploy widget data and pipeline view in application dashboard. But the product dashboard fails to fetch the commits. 

What would be the issue? I am unable to find the reason. Please update asap. Satheesh-b

287833626 @praveenkanna  - You have to run deploy collectors to insert/update your deployment info, configure pipeline widget and data will be pulled on product dashboard. You can configure Jenkins Hygieia publisher plugin on your Jenkins and it will automatically trigger push to Mongo on start of build and deployment.   nireeshT
288170630 Greetings! I am experiencing the same issue. I do not see any data being populated into the Product Dashboard. I do see my artifacts showing up in the Team Dashboard Pipeline Tab as well as the Deploy Widget on the Team Dashboard Widget Tab -- but not the Product Dashboard itself:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26578795/24160978/7461d20e-0e20-11e7-9051-3da5690bfedb.png)

I am using the #1020 merge request (Configurable Pipeline Stage Names) and boy was I ever hoping that this ongoing issue I have been having with populating the Product Dashboard would be resolved as well. I will try to explain my steps as carefully as I can, but the waters are fairly muddy here:

1) run github-scm-collector, jenkins-build-collector and artifactory-artifact-collector jars
2) Mongo is indeed running well (as well as UI and API components)
3) set up Jenkins job to build my artifacts
4) set up 3 more Jenkins jobs to deploy to my three custom stages: FOO, BAR and BAZ
5) configure Jenkins to deploy these artifacts from #4 to Artifactory

It is very hard to explain, but data never seems to show up on the Product Dashboard.

I guess my main issue is that I do not understand what data to validate in Mongo, that might help. But assuming that the data is getting there correctly and is indeed valid, are their other pieces to this puzzle that need to be made visible? 

Any help is greatly appreciated, getting this final data to show up in the Product Dashboard will make the @managers very very happy. :) ciscoemp

288223054 @praveenkanna  @ciscoemp  -  Worked with @ciscoemp  and resolved issue for COMMIT and buid. Make sure Jenkins deploy job is configured with correct values in Hygieia publisher settings. Once you do commits and run jnekins deploy jobs on different environments, they should reflect in product dashboard. Reopen if still an issue.  nireeshT

288445711 Here is a snapshop of the pipeline in Mongo. Notice that our custom stages do not have any commit records? Is this the culprit? We are running under the assumption that extra stages such as QA, Integration, Performance and Production report builds, not commits. Correct or incorrect? (Thanks in advance.)

[],"Hello,

I am currently working on creating a new template for dashboard. Where I want to have a dashboard with 6 sonarqube widgets and only those widgets and nothing else. I am working for a similar functionality for the rest of widgets too. So In short I am creating a template  with all the widgets as sonar widgets. So I want to have one sonarqube dashboard, one bamboo dashboard , udeploy dashboard etc.  

So i was able to create a template with all sonrqube widgets. The problem I am running into is the data in all the sonarqube widgets is getting reflected the same.

286214300 @kakumasn Take a look at DashboardServiceImpl and follow the code when you add a widget to the Dashboard. You'll have to change the code at multiple places to do what you are trying to achieve.

[],"We've made an installation of Hygieia and everything seems to be working fine. But when an Sprint associated with an Issue is  closed or opened that information doesn't seem to be reflected in the MongoDB until that Issue gets modified.

I've seen that the UpdatedDate of the issues is not being changed when their associated Sprint get's opened or closed, and I guess that's the reason the ""story.st"" query doesn't return those issues and thus they are not updated.

I've being reading almost all the opened and closed issues in this GitHub project and I've not seen anything related with this.... Am I missing something obvious in Jira's/Hygieia configuration?

See below the relevant configuration options

```
feature.pageSize=100

feature.deltaStartDate=2016-02-01T00:00:00.000000
feature.masterStartDate=2016-02-01T00:00:00.000000

feature.storyQuery=story

```

We have double checked that the custom_fields are properly configured.

Thanks!",213727692,1238,[JIRA] Sprint status not being updated,2017-03-13 10:34:24,2018-09-18 14:39:05,closed,2,alfonso-presa,,"286256760 That is correct. The underlying model does not have ""Sprint"" types. Instead each issue stores information about the sprint directly. As a result as you have observed updates to the sprint data will only get reflected on issues if the issue also updates.

I would think in most situations this should not be an issue. If you are closing a sprint then all the issues should be removed from the sprint. In our jira instance sprints cannot be closed with open issues. If all of the issues are closed or moved back to the backlog they would end up being updated (the spring field change) and hence you would get the sprint data updated for free.

Those query settings refer to *.st files in the code at src/main/resources/jiraapi-queries. It might be possible to set the queryFolder property and point it to a mounted directory with custom *.st queries. I've never tried it though and that code has been there before I started working with Hygieia. MarkRx
286260241 Ok. I was just wondering if there was something we were missing, but If this is a known issue or just the expected behavior then I guess we will have to live with that :-).

In our instance issues are not being updated on sprint closed/activated actions, but that might be something we have not configured properly in Jira.

Thank you very much! alfonso-presa

[],"The recursiveGetJobDetails added in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1038 for folder support makes a rest call for  every job inside a sub-folder. In other words, if jenkins at its root has 1 job and 1 folder with 10 jobs, this would result in 11 rest calls. For jenkins setups with lot of sub-folders, this would cause a performance issue.

Based on @tabladrum suggestion in the comments of https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1038, this has been changed to pull all the jobs upfront based on a folderDepth parameter that the user can set in the properties file.
The limitation of this approach is jobs inside folders deeper than folderDepth will not be collected.

This is problematic as the URL is too long. This can cause issues with load balancers, security scanners, proxies, etc. Also, building the build url should use some kind of reusable buffer. It's burning through Strings and wasting memory.

A better question to ask is why are we obtaining builds for all jobs right away? Can't we lazily obtain builds only when a job is enabled (selected)? Doing this would make the recursion in the example only use 2 rest calls. Furthermore in an enterprise instance of 1000's of jobs we will save a lot of resources by not obtaining builds for jobs we never intend to track. @tabladrum @satishc1  MarkRx
286278528 @MarkRx You could set the folderDepth to 25 and shorten the url length by half. Do you need a depth of 50? We talked about lazily loading the builds but the code as it is at present doesn't add jobs if there are no builds. From what we are seeing the recursiveGetJobDetails added in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1038 is extremely slow due to the number of rest calls its making. In the test that you ran, did it work and if it did how was the performance compared to how you were doing the recursive calls initially.
 satishc1
286461726 @MarkRx @tabladrum Set default folderDepth to 10 after verifying its sufficient for how jenkins jobs are configured for us internally. Again, this is a parameter so you can choose to increase it based on how your jenkins folders are setup. Hopefully depths greater than 20 are an oddity and not the norm. satishc1
288396647 It appears to be working. I did encounter a stack overflow error but that may or may not be related - #1257. A default of 10 sounds fine. Please add it to the generated properties file consumed by docker. MarkRx
288822962 @MarkRx @tabladrum Cool. Thanks for testing it out. I updated the generated prop file for docker. Let me merge this and we'll see if we can recreate https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1257 . satishc1

286107038 @kavitha0624  - add slf4j-simple.jar to classpath, that should solve the issue. Make sure slf4j-api.jar  is in classpath too.  nireeshT
286231178 @nireeshT, adding the slf4j-simple.jar resolved the issue  and api is starting fine now. But the jenkins collector, after adding the same jar and few other jars it asked for, it no more shows the above errors but I am seeing the below now.

[],"hi team,

i reffered one of the issue opened here for system requirement which mentioned system requirement as follows, **can you please also share what will be the minimum required disk space to be available?**:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 (Maipo)
Linux kernel 3.10.0-327.36.1.el7.x86_64
16GB Ram
The average RAM consumption will be 130 Mb for apache httpd. This will go up depending on how many users hit apache. These numbers are for light usage with about 10 people running the UI.
MongoDb 3.2.9 takes up about 1 Gb RAM.
The API process takes up about 1 Gb RAM.
On average each collector running will have RAM consumption of 1gb per collector. ",213052628,1235,System requirement to setup hygieia on linux,2017-03-09 14:27:17,2018-09-18 14:39:05,closed,2,varundevopsid99,,"285367245 @varundevopsid99  It will depend on whether you run all the modules on the same server or separate it out. Ui , api and collector modules will pretty much remain static except for log files that will grow.  The mongo data is the one you need to compute and plan for. A size of 20 to 30 Gb should be sufficient for mongo. satishc1
285416226 Thanks... Also can you let me know have you configured Docker on this linux setup?which version? and if possible can you share steps how you configured Hygieia setup in docker...thanks varundevopsid99

If using Hygieia publisher , go to Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Jenkins location section -> change the url with correct port value .

had the same(ish) issue- you need to make sure your jenkins is pushing data out to the collector. see- http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/hygieia-jenkins-plugin.html mirageglobe

286344939 Thank you so much for the prompt reply. But I have a general doubt, that how the data is stored in the collector_items collection in the MongoDB? Should I have to write a collector to get the response from plugin and store in DB? Or it is done from plugin itself? Satheesh-b
286425309 @Satheesh-b If you use the plugin, you don't need the jenkins collector. The former is push based, the later pull. satishc1

Can anyone guide us on how to resolve this issue since we are new to Hygieia.
Thanks ",212082007,1227,Hygieia build failed : could not download Node.js: Got error code 403 from the server,2017-03-06 10:33:04,2018-09-18 14:39:04,closed,9,HebbarA," LabelName= how-to's
","284734334 @HebbarA Per your comment ..""We installed node, npm, bower and gulp on linux through yum commands and removed the execution sections of these in pom.xml of UI."" 

Try reverting back to the original pom.xml file and do the build in a network not restricted by proxy.  satishc1
284951066 If is proxy issue then build should have failed for other components too. But build is failing only during installing node.js in UI step. We tried building the code after configuring proxy but still it is failing. So we installed node.js manually and removed from pom.xml. HebbarA

304634232 @HebbarA : Did you manage to resolve these problems? I am facing exact same issue. Any help will be much appreciated rrgautam
304844190 We removed node, npm from pom.xml and installed node and npm separately in our environment. HebbarA
284410897 @HebbarA Try building Hygieia on a network not restricted by proxy. If you can't then try https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1213 satishc1
284437601 Yup - you're getting a 403 Unauthorized, which looks like a proxy authentication issue.

Your company has probably already configured chrome to authenticate with your proxy for you, which is why you are able to get to them in Chrome. You'll have to set your `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables in order for tools to be able to authenticate with the proxy. mrpudn
284633631 As suggested, we have set the proxy (setting env_variables) and build the code. Getting same error.
 HebbarA
284693486 We installed node, npm, bower and gulp on linux through yum commands and removed the execution sections of these in pom.xml of UI. Now when we build the code, the build is failing to  create assembly archive src. Getting below errors

After a new build info has been imported to hygieia server, the build stage will make a request, such as http://localhost:3000/api/build/?componentId=58aba84b22b4042344b9ac6c&endDateBegins=1488258758706&endDateEnds=1488357136355, to update the latest build number.

I already found out about the Apply before ""Test Connection"", so I'm afraid it won't be that either :(

284762768 @guillermonoainquantion The hygieia-api is also running on port 8080.  Try running it on a different port ...either jenkins or hygieia-api. satishc1
331197749 @guillermonoainquantion : are you still seeing this issue after changing the port of jenkins or hygieia-api? nitin1706
331366527 I abandoned this development a few months ago, so I can't really recall the state where I left it. Thank you very much anyway! guillermonoainquantion

283694716 I did follow the same steps as in ticket : 1142
changed pom.cml in plugins to 
<version>2.0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>

1. cd to ""core"", then mvn clean install. Success.
2. cd to hygieia-jenkins-plugin, then mvn clean package. Failure.

i tried this multiple times but still get the same error .
can u pls forward me the hpi file ?  krishs123
283790389 @satyakv786 
1. 
The pomfile.txt you have attached doesn't match the log line numbers ""line 15"" etc.
(C:\Users\HOME PC\Documents\Hygieia-master\hygieia-jenkins-plugin\pom.xml) points at com.capitalone.dashboard:Hygieia instead of org.jenkins-ci.plugins:plugin, please verify your project structure @ line 15, column 13

It looks formatted wrong and has a bunch of ""-"" characters also.  So check to make sure you grab the latest pom.xml from the repo.  The only change you need to make in it is change the core dependency to 2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.

2. Do a mvn package install from the root of Hygieia.  Then check to make sure the core packages got installed in your local maven repository. If yes, then cd to the hygieia-jenkins-plugin folder and do a mvn package install. Check if your local repository is set in the maven settings if mvn has trouble locating the core jars. satishc1

Note that the data actually don't get purged off. It's the UI which restricts displaying the data. 

However, an analytics aspect of all these is a fair ask and we do have the same internally. For analytical solution, you could replicate the data on to a separate MongoDB instance and run your preferred analytics tool on that. 

On the product dashboard page, you do have a view to 90 days trend on few metrics such as code quality, build break MTR, security vulnerability etc. We are planning to add more on that area.

[],"The current state of the docker-compose file results in exceptions when attempting to run API. See below. The docker-compose API should not default to requiring Jasypt. Right now it does because the docker image is build with ""ENV SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD=ENC(aSPTk36yA/ZklUg75CrZ8w==)"" which I presume is ""password"" encrypted with a key of ""hygieiasecret"".

The following should be done:
- There should be a way to run without Jasypt. Right now I can't start my collectors with docker-compose (without overriding commands) because the docker images do not have jasypt.encryptor.password. It seems this property is required even if I am not using ENC. It could be defaulted to ""unencrypted"" in the code perhaps.
- The 5 ENV commands in the Dockerfile should be removed. None of the other Dockerfiles contain these.
- ~~All of the other collectors should support automatically setting -Djasypt.encryptor.password if set using the same mechanism as the API.~~ The JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_SECRET variable should be removed along with -Djasypt.encryptor.password=$JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_SECRET. Spring will automatically set jasypt.encryptor.password if JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD is set.
- Starting the jira collector requires the JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD (equal to jasypt.encryptor.password) to be set to ""hygieiasecret"" even through I am not using ENC. Why?

This works because of the default value of SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD in the docker image:

282721696 @MarkRx, please see my response to the points you outlined above:

- Let me think about how to accomplish this.
- Once we move to docker compose version 2 - https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/873 these ENV variables on the api's Dockerfile will be removed. Just to clarify, the rest of the collectors get these ENV variables for free because they all define a link to the hygieia-api container.
- This is on my list to do, coming out of https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1136.
- Try to bash in to your jira-collector container and print out all the env variables. I'm assuming the HYGIEIA_API_ENV_SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD is encoded (enclosed in ENC()), thus requiring the secret key. Mpluya

Additionally not all of the fields are required. Basically find which you want to use. Some might not be available on your Jira instance. To check if one is available get an issue key and open the following URL in a browser, making sure to change the Jira domain and the issue name with your values: `https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]` ebosveld

It's expecting Sprint data in the form of a raw toString due to how the api was returning the value. The Hygieia code works around this by attempting to reverse enginer that toString. If you are on a new version perhaps that bug has finally been fixed and it is correctly returning json.

Example:

I've investigated and it seems that Jenkins has endpoints that can be hit to obtain junit, jacoco, findbugs, pmd, and checkstyle data with plugins. This would be used to populate a bunch of the code quality data. There is nothing for security analysis, technical debt, or ""functional tests"".

This would allow users to use the codequality widget without relying on sonar. It would be a Jenkins specific implementation.

282013750 @avadhmr 2.0.5 supports Jenkins pipeline jobs, 2.0.4 does not. Your task is running as per the cron you have set. 0/5 min depending on how long a run takes. If you are trying to compare run times between 2.0.5 and 2.0.4, you need to make sure and empty your database so its a true comparison and not a delta. satishc1
282138560 @satishc1 both 2.0.5 and 2.0.4 are running on separate machines so I believe its a true comparison.
We are not running any pipeline jobs in our Jenkins so I don't think both the versions should take different times to collect the same data.

The major concern here is with 2.0.5, the collector is making insane amount of requests to the Production LDAP Server and thereby overloading it. Our LDAP team has requested us not to run the process because of it and hence we had to shut down the collector. This was not happening with 2.0.4 and only started with 2.0.5, that's why I think there is some issue with the recent changes done in it.
 avadhmr
282138677 Can we please reopen this as I think it still needs some investigation? avadhmr
282145426 @avadhmr Do you guys use a lot of folders / sub-folders in your jenkins job configs ? satishc1
282155441 @satishc1 -  yes there are good amount of folder/sub-folders in Jenkins.
But as I said , it works without any issues for 2.0.4 avadhmr
283828043 Any thoughts on this?
We are blocked and unable to use jenkins collector since this issue. avadhmr
283959985 I have also experienced terrible Jenkins API performance with Jenkins instances that are very large (10,000 jobs). I have not determined the root cause yet. It seems random - sometimes rest calls finish in a minute or so and sometimes they take an hour. For me it has happened with the old Hygieia instances as well. We added paging to the jenkins collector (#922) but that didn't resolve the issue. MarkRx
283970843 @avadhmr @MarkRx @tabladrum Haven't had time to look into this .. as per @avadhmr  ""The major concern here is with 2.0.5, the collector is making insane amount of requests to the Production LDAP Server and thereby overloading it.""

@avadhmr Any chance you can run it in debug mode ""once"" and upload the log ?

 avadhmr
284721040 Are you using apiKeys? If you are using username and password then each rest call will require a login which requires verification with the LDAP server. If using api keys the api rest calls will not need to hit LDAP. MarkRx
284943233 I replaced jenkins.apiKeys[0] in properties file with my API token and ran the collector.
LDAP team still reported high utilization.

280341457 @satishc1  Thankyou Satish, I've configured it , but  im able to select only ""ONE"" environment in Deployment widget, unable to see all the environments,
So in pipeline also ,seeing only either DEV/QA/PROD.. smsuresh
280345355 @smsuresh Do you have a deployment job configured with the jenkins hygieia publisher for each of the environments you want to see in hygieia ? Dev , QA , Prod etc need its own deployment jobs. Make sure you set up all the jobs and run them in jenkins and push the stuff to hygieia. satishc1
280348774 @satishc1 Yes I've jobs, It worked now

The issue was   "" I DID NOT maintain similar string Application Name for all the environment, so it didn't join them,,

Earlier I had like  APP_DEV, APP_QA  
Now I just kept them as ""APP""

I see all environments in deployment widget & ALSO in pipeline now!!

Started enjoying hygiea now, very useful tool :) smsuresh
280353565 @smsuresh Excellent. satishc1

# This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
# of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's team ID field name via the following URI where your
# queried user story issue has team set on it; your custom field name describes the
# team value you expect to see:

Anything wrong with my configuration? tinabear
279890114 @tinabear The code currently uses the TEMPO_TEAMS_REST_SUFFIX when you set feature.jiraTeamFieldName . Since you don't have tempo teams, hence the error when trying to invoke https://jira.xxxxxx.com/rest/tempo-teams/1/team . Can you find out the rest url for your team info and a sample json that is returned ? satishc1
280014868 The code does not support alternative mechanisms to representing teams outside of the tempo-team plugin at this time. The teamQuery setting does not appear to be used. MarkRx

the last commit included in my build is 30e7e19df795dea683f88df8a858d6855fb44b4c ",206925189,1166,Latest Hygieia code has broken Sonar,2017-02-10 22:41:16,2018-09-18 14:39:00,closed,8,anandsit,,"279346573 for me , not even this job/project names are being displayed..

This Sonar instance is just upgraded to Version 5.6.3 which is running in 5.2 months before

Reversely, I've another Sonar instance in Version 5.6.3, and it is running with Hygieia correctly.
Before, I set both Sonar to Hygieia, but currently only one is running fine.

290135113 @shilpsl1  update to latest code base and check. Reopen if still issue.  nireeshT
279231068 What is your deployment tool? tabladrum
279390874 Urbancode deploy shilpsl1
283141546 @shilpsl1  - update to latest code and try out below steps 

1) configure build widget, repo widget and deploy widget  and run collectors.
2) Configure pipeline with customized names for all environments deployed.
3) add team dashboard to product dashboard. 
Product dashboard should display COMMIT, BUILD and configured stages.

283171499 @nireeshT 
Tried by using latest code,
1. I got the error : PhantomJS not found on PATH
    So I copied old code Hygieia/UI/node_modules folder to new code. Then build was success.
2. I followed the the above 3 steps
    But I donot see anything in Product dashboard. Jenkins and gitlab is also configured.
    Also even though deployment was success it is showing failure.

[],"As mentioned in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1137

I followed all the steps but still Jira does not show any data. Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well? 

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
""name"" : ""Jira"",
""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
""enabled"" : true,
""online"" : true,
""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show Jira as an option).

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

Don't change AgileTool to ScopeOwner.   Clear your browser cache after step 4 you've listed above and see if that helps. satishc1
279519662 Thanks!! Now it is  resolved!! I am able to see jira data. Need to work deeper into Jira to understand what data Hygieia displays anandsit
434985586 so what helped to resolve issue can you please brief even i am facing the same issue

279004734 @anandsit Yes rebuild all your modules. If you are ever in doubt as to which modules need to be built, you can look at the list of files changed in a PR. satishc1
279031546 Set feature.jiraTeamFieldName to the empty string or remove it from your properties. MarkRx
279041523 as a general practice, it is okay to rebuild.

but in this case, will the rebuild resolve the issue ? anandsit
279043444 @MarkRx  - Let me know the right value in DB. Is it ScopeOwner or AgileTool ?

279052900 It should be AgileTool. ScopeOwner was the old one that was renamed to AgileTool. MarkRx
279057230 @MarkRx  - when it is AgileTool, the Dropdown does not list Jira as an option. 

In that case, i need to update from API and UI components as well. Because Api is still old and probably looking for ScopeOwner in DB. anandsit

279031046 The issue is something else but it looks like a bug in the error handling is causing it to get lost. According to the doc e.getStatusCode returns an Optional. I think you need to change the code to this:

```
if (e.getStatusCode().isPresent() && e.getStatusCode().get() == 401 ) {
					LOGGER.error(""Error 401 connecting to JIRA server, your credentials are probably wrong. Note: Ensure you are using JIRA user name not your email address."");

[],"Hi,

I am working on a POC for Jenkins Cucumber Reports. I have a local jenkins setup with a job that generates cucumber reports. I am trying to the publish those results on hygieia dashboard. But I am getting the below authentication error. I am not sure if it is a proxy error or something else. I am not sure if I am missing anything in the process. I have a demo soon, can anyone please help. Thank you.

279053786 @kavitha0624 Your log looks correct after the file name pattern change. You should be able to click ""+"" under Functional Tests on the quality widget and your job should show up in the dropdown. If it doesn't , check your Global hygieia publisher settings to see which api url you are pointed to. Your dashboard UI needs to be pulling from the same api. satishc1
279068817 **Thank you a bunch @satishc1** It worked now. I am able to see the details.

On the widget under functional tests header, I see like this 	DDX-IWS	71%	 7m (what does these values indicate?)

In the popup when I click on the functional test details (on widget), I am seeing this in the top --
Run# 857      Feb 10,      13:52:09Duration: 6m 33s  View Test Job 
/output	91	65	0 **(what are these numbers related to?)**

Also, in Hygieia plugin, I have given the environment name too, where will that appear on the widget? kavitha0624
279430484 @kavitha0624 Good to know its working. The numbers on the test details are from your cucumber json. Look at testdetails.html in the widgets/codeanalysis to see what the fields are.

The ""Application Name"" and ""Environment Name"" that you entered in your Testjob in Jenkins are not being used in the functional tests UI currently.  You can ""Name"" the test in the UI using the + button and call it something similar to correlate them.  In the future we will use the App Name and Env Name and tie it to the product dashboard. satishc1
502711637 Hi All,

I am having below error while publishing functional test data to Hygieia from Jenkins plugin. Any help and suggestion is appreciated.

278998408 @kavitha0624 If your test results file is on the jenkins server, you could create a JenkinsTestResults job and push the file to hygieia using the publisher plugin. Is that what you are trying to achieve in your POC ? You don't need any jenkins-cucumber properties if you go this route.

For your sonar collector error, you need to import your cert into the jvm that's running the sonar collector.  satishc1
279009239 Hi Satish, thank you so much for replying. I have tried publishing from jenkins using the hygieia plugin. I am using my company's jenkins job now.. which produces cucumber reports. Just like the above I have configured this jenkins job too. The below is the output I see. Everything seems to be fine but I am not seeing any option in the dropdown under functional tests on hygieia sonar's widget. Please help. Let me know if I need to provide any more details for you. Your support is much appreciated. Thanks.

I have crosschecked that the file cucumber.json is present here on the server where this job ran - /opt/jenkins/workspace/pymtsrv-org/ddx/DDX-IWS/ddx-iws-acceptance-tests-dev/output

279053786 @kavitha0624 Your log looks correct after the file name pattern change. You should be able to click ""+"" under Functional Tests on the quality widget and your job should show up in the dropdown. If it doesn't , check your Global hygieia publisher settings to see which api url you are pointed to. Your dashboard UI needs to be pulling from the same api. satishc1
279068817 **Thank you a bunch @satishc1** It worked now. I am able to see the details.

On the widget under functional tests header, I see like this 	DDX-IWS	71%	 7m (what does these values indicate?)

In the popup when I click on the functional test details (on widget), I am seeing this in the top --
Run# 857      Feb 10,      13:52:09Duration: 6m 33s  View Test Job 
/output	91	65	0 **(what are these numbers related to?)**

Also, in Hygieia plugin, I have given the environment name too, where will that appear on the widget? kavitha0624
279430484 @kavitha0624 Good to know its working. The numbers on the test details are from your cucumber json. Look at testdetails.html in the widgets/codeanalysis to see what the fields are.

The ""Application Name"" and ""Environment Name"" that you entered in your Testjob in Jenkins are not being used in the functional tests UI currently.  You can ""Name"" the test in the UI using the + button and call it something similar to correlate them.  In the future we will use the App Name and Env Name and tie it to the product dashboard. satishc1

[],"Using Hygieia as one tool across your enterprise for single view into your env, you can measure your progress for SDLC for your projects projects hosted on GIT. Metrics for Pulls and Issues can be added to the commits graph to show how the Pull Requests( code contributions) and Issues (ideas that help shape your project) are flowing in - and counts of developers committing, requesting a Pull and creating issues - would help us understand how popular your repo is.

Once the collector runs scanning GIT for all Pulls and Issues along with Commits as it does currently, it leaves the entries for the developers LOB/Department heads etc as TBD items so you can implement a local collector for your enterprise that scans for these and updates the fields by accessing your “HR” data sources.

[],"We found a bug in the gitlab collector that would stop you from being able to get commits if the collector ran for a repo, but the collector was misconfigured.  What would happen is the collector would have a bad configuration that didn't allow you to retrieve commits from git.  If someone then created a Gitlab repo in a dashboard, the collector would run, retrieve no commits, and set the last updated to the current time.  The ""first run"" would have been run already.  Then, when the configuration was fixed, the collector would have already done the first run, so it would only try to retrieve commits from the ""last update"" time, back 10 minutes.  Therefor never retrieving the commits from whatever value was specified for first run.  This change prevents updating the ""last update"" time on a repo unless there was a successful request made to gitlab.  Any HttpClientErrorException or ResourceAccessException will prevent the ""last update"" time from changing, which means, a newly configured repo will get it's first run again, and other repos will get all commits from the last successful run.

***Commits have been squashed for convenience.***

* The create dashboard modal has been expanded to allow selection of widgets from all 3 panes (1 below). 
* Update modal has been added to reselect which widgets the owner/admin wants to display (2 below).
* Configure icon has been added next to pane button set to allow for updates. This window can be expanded later to support extra dashboard specific configurations (3 below).
* Update is only available to owner/admin.
* Preexisting dashboards start with all widgets selected to support backwards compatibility, extraneous widgets can be removed by owner/admin.
* If no widgets are selected to be shown for a given pane, a helpful message appears explaining to any users wondering why no widgets are displayed.
* Template variable has been **removed** from the dashboard object, dashboard now maintains a map of available widget types and the panes where those widgets will be found.
* All template views have been consolidated into one single 'team.html/js' view. 

**Note** This PR allows users to select which widgets are displayed, it does not allow for multiple widgets of the same type. IE, having 2 Repository widgets is not supported.

"
[],"Jira and VersionOne refactoring in terms of making it uniform and also matching the overall design pattern of the rest of Hygieia.

1. Do not create any collector item from either VersionOne or Jira collector. Only create team and/or scope documents.
2. UI drop downs fetches data from scope (for Project drop down) and team (for team drop down)
3. Once UI config is saved, create a CollectorItem with the combination configured. The collector item will have the project and team selected on the UI. One of these has to be present, both can't be null (error validation on UI)
4. Jira collector and VersionOne collector collects feature data based on the project+team in the collector item collection. This can potentially save a lot of time in data collection too. (NOTE: This one is not included in this PR, it will be done in the future).
5. View options (such as Scrum or Kanban, Points or Count or Hours etc) are as usual saved in widget config options.

Steps to re-run the jira / versionone collectors once the PR is merged:

1. Make a backup of your database.
2. delete collector_items where collectorId in (select collectors.id from collectors where collectors.name in (""Jira"", ""VersionOne"") )
3. delete collectors where collectorType in (""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner"") 
4. Drop feature , scope , team
5. Build and install latest codebase for UI / core / api / collector.
6. Run UI, api, jira and versionone collector.
7. Clear your browser cache. Open your dashboard and re-configure your feature widget to pick the right project / team value.

Script for Steps 2, 3 and 4 is given below.

```
db.collectors.find({
	""name"" : { $in : [""Jira"", ""VersionOne""] }   
}).forEach(
	function(myDoc) {
		print('Dropping collector_items where collectorId is ' + myDoc._id);
		db.collector_items.remove( {""collectorId"" : myDoc._id} );
	}
);

print('Dropping collectors where collectorType in Feature, Scope, ScopeOwner');
db.collectors.remove({ ""collectorType"" : { $in : [""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner""] } });

print('Dropping feature collection');
db.feature.drop();

print('Dropping scope collection');
db.scope.drop();

print('Dropping team collection');
db.team.drop();
```",204312571,1137,Jira and VersionOne refactoring,2017-01-31 14:25:04,2018-09-18 14:38:57,closed,14,satishc1,,"276796284 @MarkRx Good to know its working well. Running Step 5 creates the AgileTool collectors. satishc1
276954804 Yes. I intentionally did not clean up any data because that is what the vast majority of users are going to do when upgrading. I wanted to experience what they would encounter. MarkRx
277068074 It is working now after I changed feature.jiraIssueTypeId to feature.jiraIssueTypeNames in conf. tinabear
277302393 To @MarkRx 's point, I was looking through the code yesterday, and it seems like saving of the collector information doesn't work as intended.  When changes are made to properties of a collector, such as the ""collectorType"", they are overwritten by their previous value before being saved.  I was going to open an issue on that since I wasn't sure if that was intentional, or a bug.  

This can be seen on line 55 in this file: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/CollectorTask.java

It looks like it should probably keep the ""id"" from the old collector, but allow the other properties to be updated.  

 rob-miller-777
278528049 Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well.

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
    ""name"" : ""Jira"",
    ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
    ""enabled"" : true,
    ""online"" : true,
    ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show  Jira as an option). 

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

276544262 @MarkRx @tabladrum Edited cleanup steps to add this line below. Please try it out and let us know if the exception is resolved.
db.collectors.remove({   ""collectorType"" : { $in : [""Feature"", ""Scope"", ""ScopeOwner""] }   }); satishc1
276661222 That will work, but are you prepared to handle all of the jira issues that are raised due to collectors breaking on an upgrade? Is there harm in just letting the stale records linger? MarkRx
276662383 I think we are going to put those back as deprecated. And take it out at a later date. @satishc1 is updating the PR. tabladrum
276677281 @MarkRx @tabladrum Added the deprecated collector types and committed. Will take these out at a later date. satishc1
276711907 Will test this afternoon. MarkRx
276777008 Nothing shows up under the ""Agile Content Tool Type:"" dropdown.

Looks like CollectorTask.java is just reading in and saving the existing collector by name (""Jira""). It never updates the collectorType from ScopeOwner to AgileTool.

I manually changed it in my database. Other than that it seems to be working good. Thanks. MarkRx
276792643 @MarkRx Did you do ""Step 5. Run jira and versionone collector""  after cleaning up the collections ? satishc1
276796284 @MarkRx Good to know its working well. Running Step 5 creates the AgileTool collectors. satishc1
276954804 Yes. I intentionally did not clean up any data because that is what the vast majority of users are going to do when upgrading. I wanted to experience what they would encounter. MarkRx
277068074 It is working now after I changed feature.jiraIssueTypeId to feature.jiraIssueTypeNames in conf. tinabear
277302393 To @MarkRx 's point, I was looking through the code yesterday, and it seems like saving of the collector information doesn't work as intended.  When changes are made to properties of a collector, such as the ""collectorType"", they are overwritten by their previous value before being saved.  I was going to open an issue on that since I wasn't sure if that was intentional, or a bug.  

This can be seen on line 55 in this file: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/capitalone/dashboard/collector/CollectorTask.java

It looks like it should probably keep the ""id"" from the old collector, but allow the other properties to be updated.  

 rob-miller-777
278528049 Do you want me to upgrade Hygiei API and UI as well.

After pulling the latest code, i built only Jira collector. Performed all the mentionyed cleanup task. Ran the new jira collector. The entry in the database looks like this

{
    ""_id"" : ObjectId(""589bcd2fc4c9565faf4ef41a""),
    ""_class"" : ""com.capitalone.dashboard.model.FeatureCollector"",
    ""name"" : ""Jira"",
    ""collectorType"" : ""AgileTool"",
    ""enabled"" : true,
    ""online"" : true,
    ""lastExecuted"" : NumberLong(1486605818627)
}

With this, UI did not recognize the collector (the drop down did not show  Jira as an option). 

When i change the collectorType from AgileTool to ScopeOwner, the dropdown is populated But the values in the UI are still 0 0 0 for any project and any value

[],"I'm having problems getting the frontend and API talking due to the password.

Master API contains:

[centos@devopsmetrics0 Hygieia]$ more api/target/classes/application.properties
dbname=dashboarddb
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=ENC(C9PLVDJ/1OfkT/3jvC/wEB20R1XPJtg9)
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
dbreplicaset=false
dbhostport=localhost:27017
server.contextPath=/api
server.port=8080

But the documentation says to setup Mongo with db / dbpass as the user.

I've tried reverse engineering the encrypted password, or setting a new password in Mongo, but the Java stuff for creating an encrypted password hangs.

Any clear steps on how to get the two talking, or can we update the repo so it's easier to get started?

276392175 @benjaminwootton you could also just pass an environment variable called JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD if you dont want to update your Dockerfile. The command would be : docker run -t -p 8080:8080 -v ./logs:/hygieia/logs -e ""SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=127.0.0.1"" -e ""JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=hygieiasecret"" -i hygieia-api:latest Mpluya
276403551 That works thanks - the password 'hygieiasecret' is the missing piece of info - thanks!  
Some cleanup of the docs would really help with adoption of Hygieia.  I've tried a few times but havent managed to get it started yet.

276376103 If I do a clean checkout, docker build and docker-compose run, api service fails with this:

aused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Password cannot be set empty
	at org.jasypt.commons.CommonUtils.validateIsTrue(CommonUtils.java:150)
	at org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEByteEncryptor.resolveConfigurationPassword(StandardPBEByteEncryptor.java:792)

I think because JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_SECRET is not set.  There isnt much mention of this in the docs either.

[],"Hi Satish,

The solution given to https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1131 did not work. Hence creating a new issue since #1131 was closed.

This is what I did:

1. Stopped the collector.
2. Updated the existing dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
3. Performed a commit - but it was not picked up by the collector.
4. Stopped the collector.
5. Created a new dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
6. It picked up the commit performed in step#3 above.
7. Performed a new commit - but again this was not picked up by the collector.

[],"Hi,

Have compiled the code as of 28-Jan-2017. The api, github,gulp serve collector are running without any error. Have configured the code report widget. And the widget shows the code commited today before the widget was configured. The collector also seems to be running fine at 5 min intervals as per the output below:

The problem is if I do a commit to the repo - the collector fails to capture that and hence is not displayed in the dashboard.

If I create a new dashboard with the same repo details - it thus shows the new commit. But the first dashboard which is also pointing to the same repo shows the status as of before it was configured.

The github repo is public.

Below is my application.properties file content:

# Database Name
dbname=dashboarddb

# Database HostName - default is localhost
dbhost=localhost

# Database Port - default is 27017
dbport=27017

# MongoDB replicaset
dbreplicaset=[false if you are not using MongoDB replicaset]
dbhostport=[host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3]

# Database Username - default is blank
dbusername=admin

# Database Password - default is blank
dbpassword=admin123

Please help in resolving this.

Thanks.

276094788 @rohanb3 Looks like you might have saved credentials for a public repo in your widget. If your repo is public, you don't need to save the credentials. So blank them out and re-save the config in your repo widget and then run the github collector. satishc1
276116636 Hi Satish,

This is what I did:

1. Stopped the collector.
2. Updated the existing dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
3. Performed a commit - but it was not picked up by the collector.
4. Stopped the collector.
5. Created a new dashboard with blank credentials and restarted the collector.
6. It picked up the commit performed in set#3 above.
7. Performed a new commit - but again this was not picked up by the collector.

Regards,
Rohan rohanb3
276126925 @rohanb3 I'm assuming you are not getting any errors in your collector now that you've blanked your credentials out.

Now the commits will get picked as per your desired cron setting. You've set this to 
github.cron=0 0/5 * * * *

Leave the collector running (don't keep resetting it) for a 2 hour period (and do some commits in this time period) and see how the commits get collected based on your cron setting and refer to this to change this setting. http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html

Check your collector log for the 2 hour period. You should either see errors or you should see commits fetched based on your cron setting. satishc1

[],"Resolves #1031. This was considerably bigger than @brennanananan and I had realized going in, but we feel like we have it at a really good spot. Test it out and let us know if there are any changes you would like to see or issues we need to address.  We are anticipating plenty of questions due to the nature of the pull request and it's size. 

**What's Included**
- Implemented JWT to provide stateless authentication/authorization
- Updated angular client to work with JWT tokens
- Made token expiration configurable
- Implemented redirect functionality to take you to the page you were viewing if you token expires and the API returns a 401 status code
- Made secret key configurable to support having multiple instances of the API running
- Added Spring Security to Rest API
- Built in support for multiple forms of authentication (standard and ldap auth currently implemented)
- Refactored current login to work with Spring Security
- Created a UserInfo Repository separate from the Authentication repository to support multiple forms of authentication. This lets us control all application specific details of a user such as roles and themes independent of the authentication type. (Themes are still only handled by the angular app on the client, and saved in local storage, but this is something we can now save for a user if we want to)
- Made admin a ""role"" instead of just assigning admin privileges to the user named ""admin"". (Haven't implemented a way to assign new admins yet, so right now it works as before where the user named ""admin"" is given the role of admin, this is handled on the backend.  There is no way to give an ldap user ""admin"" privileges currently unless their name is actually ""admin"")
- Added method level security to dashboard modification controller so only owners of the dashboard or admins can modify a dashboard
- Added support for having multiple owners of a dashboard (have not created anyway to assign multiple owners yet, but shouldn't be hard to do)
- Implemented new owner functionality in such a way that it won't break backwards compatibility",203696480,1129,Spring Security/JWT Implementation,2017-01-27 17:42:15,2018-09-18 14:38:56,closed,41,rob-miller-777,,"299491245 @rob-miller-777 ,Thanks for your response.Still am getting same exception.

299511566 Think your issue might be with the spaces in ""UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr"", probably has to be url encoded. Try replacing that with ""UD_DH_Nexus%20Rep%20Mgr"". rob-miller-777
299609538 @gokulknewt - Or you can try ""auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389/DC=qcorpaa,DC=aa,DC=com"", it's just a configuration issue based on your own ldap server, the hygieia code is OK. wdquan1985
299954128 @wdquan1985,

Could you please provide clear structure on auth.ldapUserDnPattern. Also to connect my Active directory i have define uname and password. how to define that.Could you please assist to us?

Here is the out dir. structure...

300034547 @gokulknewt - I want to help you but I think I had told you all the things I know. May be you can setup a simple ldap server for verifying the ldap authentication. Or you can capture the data package using tcpdump command in Linux or wireshark in windows.

Have your ldap server been used for other web system? if yes, you can capture the data package when login, then compare it with the the data package captured for hygieia login.

287663409 I test the ldap authentication function using this branch https://github.com/StateFarmIns/Hygieia/tree/springSecurityIntegration.
I use shell script to send build info to hygieia, for example:
curl --connect-timeout 10 -m 60 -i -X POST --header ""Content-Type:application/json"" -H ""Accept:application/json"" --data
'{""artifactName"":""SANDBOX"",""canonicalName"":""SANDBOX"",""artifactGroup"":""SANDBOX"",""artifactVersion"":""1.0"",""buildId"":""timestamp"",""timestamp"":1488942038335,""sourceChangeSet"":[{""scmUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/gerrit/60730"",""scmBranch"":""1.0"",""scmRevisionNumber"":""Ica15fe4f1f9d05a3c6bf74b7c0df8191565fcf76"",""scmAuthor"":""ZHANG,Harry(Harry)"",""scmParentRevisionNumbers"":[""d61cbc08f08bb8f674c41b4f55ff6e4fd784378d""],""type"":""New"",""scmCommitTimestamp"":1488963918000,""numberOfChanges"":1}],""metadata"":{""jobName"":""SANDBOX"",""buildUrl"":""127.0.0.1/job/SANDBOX/179/"",""buildNumber"":179,""jobUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/job/SANDBOX/"",""instanceUrl"":""http://127.0.0.1/""}}' -u userName:password http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/artifact .
I have send the username and password to hygieia, but there is an error:
{""timestamp"":1489558957506,""status"":401,""error"":""Unauthorized"",""message"":""Full authentication is required to access this resource"",""path"":""/api/artifact""}

Then I permit the url request which start with api by changing code in the spring security java configuration file com.capitalone.dashboard.config.WebSecurityConfig.java.
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http.headers().cacheControl();
http.csrf().disable()
.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(""/appinfo"").permitAll()

.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)

}.

But it still can't work, how can I configure to ignore the authentication and authorization checks?
When I send the jenkins build into to hygieia, there is no any error, but the hygieia mongo db can't search the corresponding record. wdquan1985
287664112 I add .antMatchers(""/build"",""/artifact"",""/quality/**"").permitAll(), because I use shell script to send build info, artifact info and sonarQube report to hygieia server.
I have not used the jenkins plugin. I only use shell script, is your temporary solution avilable for shell script?
For example:
curl --connect-timeout 10 -m 60 -i -X POST --header ""Content-Type:application/json"" -H ""Accept:application/json"" -u userName:password --data '{~~~~~~}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/build
If I don't add .antMatchers(""/build"",""/artifact"",""/quality/**"").permitAll(), how can I make it work ?  wdquan1985
287772769 My most recent commit should allow your shell script to send data.  It pretty much does what you were doing.  Take a look at this commit here from last week. https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1129/commits/5cb339442d1c643aa8343ceaa4b212c347473841 rob-miller-777

294420807 @rob-miller-777 same as @wdquan1985 , I met the 401 even on the latest code base:

Could you hint where am I wrong? 
I've setup api- properties as with auth.secret=hygieiasecret

As far as I suppose, there should be a header of ""Authorization: Bearer <JWT>"", the question is where I could find/create this token?
Thanks

294515482 I'm having a hard time replicating this issue.  With the code base in master, the jenkins plugin doesn't seem to have any issue for me sending requests to the api.   rob-miller-777
294515539 @wdquan1985 Are you still having this issue? rob-miller-777
294640819 @rob-miller-777 Resolved.  The code allows 'http://10.35.24.62:3002/api/deploy' but not 'http://10.35.24.62:3002/api/deploy/' . Any slash at the tail is restricted :P    xpdable
294865579 Ah, makes sense.  Think that's ok though since the jenkins plugin doesn't add the slash.   rob-miller-777
295059465 @rob-miller-777 @satishc1 Regarding the possibility of AD LDS Service on LDAP, is there an plan of that ? xpdable
295293411 I'm going to be perfectly honest and say I am not an LDAP expert, so I'm not sure what all would need to change.  However, from what little I do know, LDAP is just a protocol for querying something like active directory, so I would guess this should already be handled.  I could be misreading your question though. rob-miller-777
295509040 @rob-miller-777 Honestly, I am not either but we'd like to integrate enterprise level authorization with that.
Let me explain a little more with the Jenkins setting. 
Our AD LDS is required a Manger DN and password for any user to login where I toggled in yellow background. Now for Hygieia setting I could only see the setting for the red underline part of user.
So questions is where I should put my Manager DN, etc...
Correct me if I am doing wrong in Hygieia API properties file :)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2903719/25207677/dce7f0bc-25a2-11e7-8fba-0a8f3d63ed97.png)

295559351 @xpdable, @rob-miller-777  - My ldap server info is as following:
% ldapsearch \
-xLLL \
-h ************************.com \
-p 3000 \
-b ""dc=Internal,dc=Users,dc=Bruce"" \
""uid=bruce"" \
uid displayName mail businessTitle JobFamily telephoneNumber mobile

dn: polarisuid=bruce,dc=Internal, dc=Users, dc=Bruce
uid: bruce
displayName: ******************
mail: ************************
businessTitle: ******************
JobFamily: ***********************
telephoneNumber: ***************
mobile: *********************



And I configure ldap for hygieia as following:
auth.expirationTime=
auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://*******************.com:3791/dc=internal,dc=users,dc=Bruce
auth.ldapUserDnPattern=polarisuid={0}

Then ldap authenticaition can work. wdquan1985
295760073 With how it's implemented currently, there is no way to get the manager dn and password through, however, it should be a pretty trivial change to make this happen.  I am currently working on letting Hygieia utilize ldap groups to determine admin access, so I could include the ability to pass through more ldap settings such as manager dn. rob-miller-777
295760385 Is it not working for you with just those two settings available to you? rob-miller-777
295772259 @rob-miller-777 @xpdable @wdquan1985 We will be merging a PR for ActiveDirectory support. satishc1
296000016 @rob-miller-777 problem is... 100 percent sure I need the Manager login to use our AD LDS,  therefore I am not sure where to set the password in those two settings even I could set DN after the ldaps url as @wdquan1985 does :sob: 

@wdquan1985 Have you even try some login with a admin and password in the config?

@satishc1  Thanks, anyway looks forward the AD support with manager credential  xpdable
296003404 @xpdable - You don't need to set password in those two settings, you just need to enter you username and password in the login page.

 wdquan1985
296206186 I believe it has to do with how it's configured.  I have a pull request I am going to open soon that allows you to set the manager dn and password.  It will also let you use an ldap group to select admins.   rob-miller-777

You need to configure ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern="" according to your own ldap configuration, it maybe ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern=polarisuid={0}"" or ""auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0}"" or others. wdquan1985
298633161 **@wdquan198**5-Thanks for your detailed info.Although,we have few clarifications.Can you please demonstrate on this.
**Q1#**There is seems to be u didn't define the LDAP username and password from applcation.properties file.Does it require to connect uname and pword?
**Q2#** auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://*******************.com:3791/dc=internal,dc=users,dc=Bruce. 
       Can we use   tls 1.0 protocol instead of ldap protocols.
**Q3#** To authenticate the only admin user only can authenticate  others user also can we do the autnticate while entering login page.

Regards,
Gokul k

 gokulknewt
298806077 @gokulknewt - Q1# we don't need uname and pword in the application.properties file, because the uname and password will be captured in the login page where you try to login.
Q2# spring security framework supports ldap authentication, but I don't know if it support tls 1.0 authentication, you can search spring security materials to identify it.
Q3# I have used a commen user not admin user to authenticate, and it was successfull.

You can learn more about the whole process of ldap authentication. wdquan1985
299436131 @wdquan1985,
we have tried to connect active directory,but while run the api.jar itself we are getting exception.Could you please let me know the configuration whether we configure right approach or not

**My configuration file looks like:**
auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389/OU=UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr,OU=Applications,OU=Groups,DC=qcorpaa,DC=aa,DC=com

auth.ldapUserDnPattern=Z1061076={0}

when run the api jar am getting exception like this

Regards,
Gokul k





 gokulknewt
299484237 Try something more like this, 
`auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389`
`auth.ldapUserDnPattern=uid={0},ou=UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr,ou=Applications,ou=Groups,dc=qcorpaa,dc=aa,dc=com`

I'm not sure about the user dn pattern, you need the dn pattern to your users. And I don't know what yours would be. rob-miller-777
299491245 @rob-miller-777 ,Thanks for your response.Still am getting same exception.
When am try to run the api.jar am getting exception.For that can you provide me the right direction.

Thanks,
Gokul k

 gokulknewt
299511566 Think your issue might be with the spaces in ""UD_DH_Nexus Rep Mgr"", probably has to be url encoded. Try replacing that with ""UD_DH_Nexus%20Rep%20Mgr"". rob-miller-777
299609538 @gokulknewt - Or you can try ""auth.ldapServerUrl=ldap://dc2.qcorpaa.aa.com:389/DC=qcorpaa,DC=aa,DC=com"", it's just a configuration issue based on your own ldap server, the hygieia code is OK. wdquan1985
299954128 @wdquan1985,

Could you please provide clear structure on auth.ldapUserDnPattern. Also to connect my Active directory i have define uname and password. how to define that.Could you please assist to us?

Here is the out dir. structure...
qcorpaa.aa.com/Support User Accounts/Applications/Devops dashboard,

Regards,
Gokul k


 gokulknewt
300034547 @gokulknewt - I want to help you but I think I had told you all the things I know. May be you can setup a simple ldap server for verifying the ldap authentication. Or you can capture the data package using tcpdump command in Linux or wireshark in windows.

Have your ldap server been used for other web system? if yes, you can capture the data package when login, then compare it with the the data package captured for hygieia login.

I have Hygieia set up on a system and can run each piece correctly using the gulp
serve.  This means the API comes and connects to mongod and the UI launches under
gulp and I can access the dashboard through the UI interface.   I have been asked to
get the UI up under Tomcat rather than gulp serve.  To do this I set up Tomcat on the
same system, changed the port to 8090 so it did not conflict with the API Tomcat instance
and then moved the UI dist folder under the Tomcat webapps folder (and renamed it to
Hygieia).  Now, if I access Tomcat on that system and tell it specifically to bring up Hygieia .....
                                        localhost:8090/Hygieia
the login page appears but the API Connectivity shows no connection.

I have seen that in the gulpfile.js file, a proxy is set up to point to localhost:8080 where the 
instance of the API Tomcat would be.  I thought that is what I need to add to the start up of 
my instance of Tomcat but so far everything I have tried (adding proxy elements to both the
catalina.sh and to the JAVA_OPT in the catalina.properties files) does not work. 

I have looked through numerous other posts to try and find nuggets that I might be able
to look into to help me crack this nut - one post asked the submitter for the UI log files.  I
have not been able to find these on my system and I am pretty sure they might provide
some insight.

At this point I am thinking I am making this much more difficult than it has to be.  Any help
that anyone might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.",203253275,1127,Problems getting Hygieia UI under Tomcat to connect to API,2017-01-25 23:27:08,2018-09-18 14:38:56,closed,9,amayesthing," LabelName= how-to's

You are welcome! Here it is..

1. Build the Hygieia API project as a WAR artifact instead of JAR. i.e, Change the packaging to war in API project pom.xml, like below:
`<packaging>war</packaging>`
and re-build the API project.

2. Deploy the api*.war file in Tomcat.

3. Hygieia API requires the ""dashboard.properties"" file for MongoDB connectivity. To set this up with in Tomcat container, do the following:
       - Add a CATALINA_OPTS variable in Catalina.bat (or. sh under Linux) file like below (update the path based on your environment):
         `set CATALINA_OPTS=""-Dspring.config.location=file:C:\DevOps\HygieiaApi\dashboard.properties""`

   Note : I added the above variable right below this line:
           :java_dir_displayed
           echo Using CLASSPATH:       ""%CLASSPATH%""
           set CATALINA_OPTS=""-Dspring.config.location=file:C:\DevOps\HygieiaApi\dashboard.properties""

Restart your Tomcat server. You should be able to run the UI that should connect to your API deployed within Tomcat successfully. Try it out!

I got this working by deploying the Hygieia API within the Tomcat container. Basically, the UI and the API are deployed within Tomcat and all the collectors are running as a stand-alone java processes. It works good and also provides an opportunity to scale-up & load balance APIs, if needed.

Let me know if you are interested in this deployment, I can document the changes (2 changes) and will send it out to you. spyndi

We have Rally which is SSO integrated and this is identity provider initiated. In which case Rally URL would not work due to IDP redirection. How does one generate security token in such scenarios to be used with REST APIs inside collector?

458178128 If I'm understanding the question here, you have SSO login in front of your tools (e.g. Jira) and you want the collector to get past this. The answer will depend on the specific tool.

For example, in the case of the Jira collector, you can generate a token and use that in place of a password. In the case of SonarQube collector, a generated token stands in for the username and no password is required.

Your best bet is to refer to the docs for your product. spyoungtech

I'm having this case with rally, is there a way to handle it in rally collector. Naveenraaj
458391720 Sorry, I'm not familiar with rally. I would suggest referring to the product documentation. 

A [quick search](https://communities.ca.com/thread/241782087-sso-saml-api-authorization) seems to indicate that an API shouldn't require SAML/SSO auth. Additionally, it seems that you can add exceptions for specific users, say, for example a service account.

I want to know if there is any possible way for aggregating various modules which form one complete application.
In our case we have application divided into multiple independent components having separate git repos, jenkins jobs , sonar projects etc.

Thanks for support.
I have some questions here. Can you please help me here..

1.  On product dashboard page, it displays data for commit, build, dev,qa, int, perf... prod.
     Many time team deploys code in QA and Perf at the same time.
     Also, some time they really skip deployment in INT environment.. 
     how does product dash board behave in such cases.. or its always compulsory to follow sequence of   deployments.

2. Jenkin plugin push build and deployment data to Hygieia into build, artifact and environment_compontents collections.
   Do we still need run any deployment collector?

[],"Hello

Currently Hygieia allows the user to select a ""template"" from a hard coded list (capone, caponechatops, splitview, etc). The purpose from what I can tell (please correct me in the comments if I am wrong) is merely to change which widgets are displayed on initial dashboard creation. At this point there does not exist a way to easily create, modify, or delete these templates. 

My proposal is to remove the notion of these templates, and allow the users to select which widgets they would like to be displayed during the dashboard creation configuration window.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20029463/22209899/43d351b0-e145-11e6-8ee1-6233ab482f03.png)

The screenshot is a POC for the widgets on the ""Widget"" tab only. The change can easily be propagated to the ""Pipeline"" and ""Cloud"" tabs as well. In the case the all widgets are excluded, the tab will not show. For example, on the screen shot above, if all widgets are deselected, the ""Widget"" tab on the actual dashboard will be removed.

On a similar note, if a user decides that they would like all of the widgets shown in the example, the dashboard becomes too large to fit in one screen. Having a page that requires scrolling for an application like this may become cumbersome for users. 
Two solutions have been suggested for this:
* Limit the amount of widgets in a dashboard.
* If the page requires scrolling, have the page slowly move up and down automatically to show all widgets.

Both approaches have merit, please let me know if there is feedback.

This change would allow teams to show precisely the information they desire, and would result in a cleaner looking dashboard instance in the case that a team does not want to utilize all widgets included in a pre-baked template.

Looking forward, this change incorporates adding widgets directly to the dashboard object itself. This can be utilized in the future to allow addition/deletion of widgets to pre-exiting dashboards.",202568680,1116,Proposal to remove templates from UI,2017-01-23 15:40:58,2018-09-18 14:38:55,closed,2,brennanananan,,"277077750 See https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1143 for PR brennanananan

274087170 The cause of the null pointer is this: API call is made to retrieve a dashboard, but the dashboard is not there in the ""dashboard"" collection in Mongo. If you have removed the data from Mongo, I am thinking (a) there is some other browser instance still trying to pull up an old dashboard or (2) Your browser has the URL in the history and you are using that as a bookmark and that creates the error. 

Other than those, I cant think of anything else. Would like to see it in a screen share if possible.  tabladrum
274113025 Having said that, the API should return a 404 in this case. tabladrum

By adding these four lines of code into the LoggingFilter.java file and running the maven build on the api layer, cross origin domains are accepted.

I am running only one team dash board and one product dashboard. Hygieia is build on three docker containers (mongo -->api --> ui). Collectors also run on the same server. I do not see much of CPU or high memory usage on servers. But every two days, the API container crashes with the below errors

274181324 Do you see anything wrong in the mongo container when this happens? tabladrum
274220293 I think, running DB, hygieia, collectos all on one VM is causing this issue..

the DB was intermittently accessible. 

I am planning/requesting for a trouble shooting session on Wednesday 10:00am, please let me know your availability @tabladrum 

Issues that i have currently are

1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of  data in database
2. Team dashboard has stash data but the product dash board shows blank when the same team dash board is part of product dashboard
3.  anandsit
274570796 @anandsit About #2 in your list, please see this: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1112#issuecomment-274189787

The VM sizing will purely depend upon what load it has. We internally spilt everything into multiple VMs: Mongo Clusters, API, UI and Collectors all run in different cloud instances. tabladrum
276096316 @anandsit Closed. About ""#1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of data in database"", Will be addressed with https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/1054 satishc1

274181324 Do you see anything wrong in the mongo container when this happens? tabladrum
274220293 I think, running DB, hygieia, collectos all on one VM is causing this issue..

the DB was intermittently accessible. 

I am planning/requesting for a trouble shooting session on Wednesday 10:00am, please let me know your availability @tabladrum 

Issues that i have currently are

1. Jira shows 0,0,0 in-spite of  data in database
2. Team dashboard has stash data but the product dash board shows blank when the same team dash board is part of product dashboard
3.  anandsit
274570796 @anandsit About #2 in your list, please see this: https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/issues/1112#issuecomment-274189787

The VM sizing will purely depend upon what load it has. We internally spilt everything into multiple VMs: Mongo Clusters, API, UI and Collectors all run in different cloud instances. tabladrum

274102954 Hi @evaldasou builds show up in builds widget drop down. For deployment, publish deployment option. Are you using pipeline or standard job config?  tabladrum
274196855 Hi @tabladrum , I have used ""Freestyle project"" maybe that's an issue? 
Does it work only with ""Pipeline"" or ""Multibranch Pipeline"" ? 

Thanks! evaldasou
274205649 Works with freestyle as well as pipeline. For freestyle, configure Hygiea publisher as post build action and select to publish deploy data. You will need an App Name to publish under (this is the one you will select in Hygieia deploy widget config drop down), an env name (whatever you want such as Dev, QA, Prod etc), a namespace, select which artifacts are being deployed (files under your workspace, supports wildcard) and optionally version number. Supply version number if the filename does not contain version number.  tabladrum
274220340 Thanks @tabladrum , but I followed all the examples and configured it exactly it says. I am getting Hygieia plugin success messages in Jenkins... getting data in mongo database collections...

277820565 Setting Jenkins Security to false is not acceptable because it means anybody can do anything without any authentication configured. indrgun
277851415 By using the following format for the jenkins server, you should be able to config the collector to read (provided the user has read access):

``jenkins.servers[0]=https://user:apikey@jenkins-server.com``

But on Hygieia UI side under teams dropdown it's picking up the projects name as team names which seems like odd behaviour.

So in my case i am getting same names under the project and team dropdown on Hygieia UI. Shouldn't team dropdown display only 'any' in dropdown in case i havent congigured any teams in Jira? varundevopsid99

I have cloned the Master now and started building each module. I was able to mvn install successfully the Core module. But when I am building api module, I am seeing the below error and the build fails. The .m2 settings.xml has the company's proxy settings. Please help.

273414312 @tabladrum , I have added few log info's in this method makeRestCall which is in DefaultHudsonClient.java, just to check the values. The below is what it appears on the console --
```java
protected ResponseEntity<String> makeRestCall(String sUrl) throws MalformedURLException {
        URI thisuri = URI.create(sUrl);
        String userInfo = thisuri.getUserInfo();
        LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is url and uri:  ""+sUrl+""....""+thisuri);
        //get userinfo from URI or settings (in spring properties)
        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(userInfo) && (this.settings.getUsername() != null) && (this.settings.getApiKey() != null)) {
            userInfo = this.settings.getUsername() + "":"" + this.settings.getApiKey();
        }
        LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is userinfo and uri:  ""+userInfo);
        // Basic Auth only.
        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(userInfo)) {
        	LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m in if block"");
            return rest.exchange(thisuri, HttpMethod.GET,
                    new HttpEntity<>(createHeaders(userInfo)),
                    String.class);
        } else {
        	LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m in else block"");
            return rest.exchange(thisuri, HttpMethod.GET, null,
                    String.class);
        }

    }
```
In getBuildDetails method -
```java
ResponseEntity<String> result = makeRestCall(url);
            LOG.info(""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i m result""+result);
```
**This is a bit lengthy log, I will cut it short if you want me to.**

wherever you are seeing ""heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this is userinfo and uri:  "", I am actually printing only userinfo here but not uri.

For each build of the job, why is the call happening two times once with actual values from properties file and the other null? both the if and else blocks are being executed here in this method.

Once I restarted my machine in order to gather the information you requested, the SCM widget accepted the password successfully without having to modify anything. Although I had restarted the processes several times today, it seems restarting my machine did the trick. I do see the credentials with an encrypted password in the database as well. Unfortunately, I'm getting '401 Unauthorized' from the Bitbucket collector when it attempts to retrieve commits from the repository. I'll do more research to see if I can identify the issue. Thanks again. rdsteele
272603765 I was able to get the Bitbucket collector to work finally, but I did find an issue. The password I was using had a special character (#) which caused a problem with the encrypt/decrypt function. Once I switched to an alphanumeric password, the decryption worked and I was able to obtain the commit information. I'll open a new issue once I gather more information. Thanks again. rdsteele
273561935 @rdsteele @satishc1 - I followed the steps for generating the secret key and updated the same in 
api properties file as well as bitbucket properties file but still getting the same error. 

I also changed the password to only contain alphanumeric but still getting the same encryption error. Could you please provide the detailed steps to resolve this issue?

Thanks for your help in advance. asub927
273865733 So, my understanding is the password encryption error in the UI SCM widget configuration was solved by generating the secret key and adding that to the API properties file as 'key=secretkeyvalue'. This should allow the API to encrypt the password and store the credentials in the database. I also restarted my machine; stopping and starting the API process didn't seem to work for some reason, not sure why.

1. java -jar core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
    Your secret key is:
    NH***************************TC

2. Property added to api.properties (or whatever your file is named)
    key=NH********************************TC

Adding the secret key to the Bitbucket properties allows the collector to read the encrypted password from the database, decrypt it and call Bitbucket. If this fails, you'll probably be getting a 401 Unathorized error, which is how I discovered the issue with the '#' special character.

3. Property added to Bitbucket git.properties  (or whatever your file is named)

Functionality merged in https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/pull/835
Refer to the ""Encryption for private repos"" section in the UI module readme.

272560484 I did follow the ""Encryption for private repos"" section in the UI module readme, as well as read many other issues that were related. I am also getting the error stated above.

Here are the steps I took:
C:\Hygieia-master\core\target>java -jar core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
Your secret key is:
NH********************************TC
Sample encrypted string with the above key for 'thisIsMyPassword' is:
Fa+n*****************bpv

Property added to api.properties
key=NH********************************TC

Property added to Bitbucket collector file (git.properties)
git.key=NH********************************TC

So, what am I missing? Thanks rdsteele
272597794 @rdsteele Can you paste the command you used to startup the api along with the resulting log? If you can do the same with debug enabled that could help. I would like to see the error in the api log when you click the Save button on the repo widget.
@asub927 Let us know if it worked for you or if its still an issue. satishc1
272600277 Thanks for the quick response. Once I restarted my machine in order to gather the information you requested, the SCM widget accepted the password successfully without having to modify anything. Although I had restarted the processes several times today, it seems restarting my machine did the trick. I do see the credentials with an encrypted password in the database as well. Unfortunately, I'm getting '401 Unauthorized' from the Bitbucket collector when it attempts to retrieve commits from the repository. I'll do more research to see if I can identify the issue. Thanks again. rdsteele
272603765 I was able to get the Bitbucket collector to work finally, but I did find an issue. The password I was using had a special character (#) which caused a problem with the encrypt/decrypt function. Once I switched to an alphanumeric password, the decryption worked and I was able to obtain the commit information. I'll open a new issue once I gather more information. Thanks again. rdsteele
273561935 @rdsteele @satishc1 - I followed the steps for generating the secret key and updated the same in 
api properties file as well as bitbucket properties file but still getting the same error. 

I also changed the password to only contain alphanumeric but still getting the same encryption error. Could you please provide the detailed steps to resolve this issue?

Thanks for your help in advance. asub927
273865733 So, my understanding is the password encryption error in the UI SCM widget configuration was solved by generating the secret key and adding that to the API properties file as 'key=secretkeyvalue'. This should allow the API to encrypt the password and store the credentials in the database. I also restarted my machine; stopping and starting the API process didn't seem to work for some reason, not sure why.

1. java -jar core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
    Your secret key is:
    NH***************************TC

2. Property added to api.properties (or whatever your file is named)
    key=NH********************************TC

Adding the secret key to the Bitbucket properties allows the collector to read the encrypted password from the database, decrypt it and call Bitbucket. If this fails, you'll probably be getting a 401 Unathorized error, which is how I discovered the issue with the '#' special character.

3. Property added to Bitbucket git.properties  (or whatever your file is named)
    git.key=NH********************************TC

I am running my UDeploy Collector through a debugger and noticing that environment variable in UDeployCollectorTask.java is being populated properly wiht my environment ""dev"".   But compList and combinedDataList are of size 0.   The calls to the uDeploy rest api for my environment seem to be working fine.

And also the UCD version? tabladrum
273488522 I try daily, even yesterday made a deployment to check whether it works.
UCD Version which i am using -  6.2.1. shilpsl1
273495840 @spyndi , no, tried different possobilities, nothing seems to work.

@tabladrum, same here, there was a deployment yesterday. the version of the UCD is 6.2.2. shouebs
275159524 @tabladrum @shilpsl1 @spyndi 

Is there any progress on this issue ? Did anyone get it working ? shouebs
275163776 we had a call and found that i was using 6.2.1 version of UCD. It is working fine with UCD version 6.1. 
May be some issue with 6.2 and above version of UCD.
@shouebs  what version of UCD are you using ? shilpsl1
275182943 @shilpsl1  Thanks for the update. I am using 6.2.2 .  Do you have any information if the issue with 6.2 will be fixed ? shouebs

May be @tabladrum has to answer this... He said he would check and come back to me this week on this issue. But I did not hear anything so far from him .... shilpsl1
275188409 @shilpsl1 Thanks.
@tabladrum Please keep us posted if there is any progress with fixing the issue with UCD version 6.2 and above. shouebs
275200782 @shilpsl1 @tabladrum 
FYI - We are also using UCD 6.2.1 version and running into the same issue as reported above.

@tabladrum - I was doing some debugging with the UDeploy collector code and may have some additional data for troubleshooting.

I see that the method ""getLowestLevelChildren"" in DefaultUDeployClient class is returning a null JSONArray and hence the subsequent calls in the stack is not collecting any data for the widget.

`private JSONArray getLowestLevelChildren(JSONObject topParent, JSONArray returnArray) {
        JSONArray jsonChildren = (JSONArray) topParent.get(""children"");

        if (jsonChildren != null && jsonChildren.size() > 0) {
            for (Object child : jsonChildren) {
                if (!hasChildren((JSONObject) child)) {
                    returnArray.add(child);
                } else {
                    getLowestLevelChildren((JSONObject) child, returnArray);
                }
            }
        }
        return returnArray;
    }`

The input JSONObject to this method is -

{""parent"":{""inheritTeam"":false,""active"":true,""description"":""Test - Application"",""prototype"":false,""tags"":[],""impersonationForce"":false,""path"":""\/test-103831"",""security"":{""Delete"":false,""Manage Impersonation"":false,""Manage Teams"":false,""Edit Basic Settings"":false,""read"":false,""Map to Environments"":false,""View Resources"":false,""write"":false,""Manage Children"":false,""Create Resources"":false,""Manage Properties"":false},""hasAgent"":false,""name"":""test-103831"",""impersonationPassword"":""****"",""securityResourceId"":""d346ec32-9622-4364-92d2-4938617ca6bc"",""id"":""f3c72817-394e-48f5-8e4a-f314816a61f6"",""impersonationUseSudo"":false,""discoveryFailed"":false},""isRoot"":true,""inheritTeam"":true,""resource"":{""id"":""c0d838a4-fe9a-4533-a0b1-33c87629a701""},""hasChildren"":true,""active"":true,""description"":""CIT2"",""type"":""subresource"",""prototype"":false,""tags"":[],""impersonationForce"":false,""path"":""\/test-103831\/CIT2"",""security"":{""Delete"":false,""Manage Impersonation"":false,""Manage Teams"":false,""Edit Basic Settings"":false,""read"":true,""Map to Environments"":false,""View Resources"":true,""write"":false,""Manage Children"":false,""Create Resources"":false,""Manage Properties"":false},""hasAgent"":false,""versions"":[],""name"":""CIT2"",""impersonationPassword"":""****"",""securityResourceId"":""c0d838a4-fe9a-4533-a0b1-33c87629a701"",""id"":""301b972c-668e-4b9a-a0b0-4c9814889b40"",""impersonationUseSudo"":false,""discoveryFailed"":false}

In short, I don't see a ""children"" node or tag in this JSON construct. I wonder if there is an API/Response change between UCD 6.1.x and 6.2.x is the root cause of this issue.

BTW, the ""getLowestLevelChildren"" method is being called from ""getEnvironmentResourceStatusData"" method and I see a comment about some ""new logic"" that was introduced on Dec16/2015. Please check.

If you would like me to step through the code via. Webex let me know, we can schedule some time.

Anyone has any update regarding this.

Please let me know if anyone has go solution. Thank you!!! shilpsl1
282102799 @spyndi @tabladrum 
In DefaultUDeployClient getLowestLevelChildren needs to be changed to handle the 6.2 .  It might be a new api call to Udeploy to get the children based on ""hasChildren"": true . It needs to be backward compatible with 6.1 also.

The mapping we are looking for is for each childObject:
version
fileName

The images below show the actual uDeploy widget. The rows in the uDeploy widget are links for the various environments. The images for each link when you click on it is also shown.

We are trying to connect and get the data from IBM UrbanCode Deploy tool(version 6.2.2.0.830952) via Hygieia code. we are able to get the application detail from configuration widget from dropdown. Once hit the save button from widget,In UCD not showing up in Hygieia Dashboard.

Also while running collector for UCD 6.2.2 we are not getting child element from parent node.So,how do we handle that.Is ther any roadmap for this to handle this issue.

288191867 @jlk1975 - I have started working on updating Hygieia uDeploy collector to use uDeploy API 6.2.x. Because of other priorities/delays on my side, the work/fix is still in progress. 
I'm targeting the fix to be ready for testing by end of this month. (03/31). Let's touch base next week. spyndi

An update,
There is quite a lot of changes with 6.2 API, so it's getting a little challenging with incorporating these changes in the existing collector and back porting with 6.1 implementation . I have collected some data points for discussion with @satishc1  and @tabladrum, to make sure it fulfills the existing UI flow and requirement.  Will be reviewing with them shortly.

Has anyone looked into UDeploy 6.2 API? I would like to brainstorm some thoughts/ideas on the implementation.

Thank you. spyndi

293673370 @Spyndi, Have you done the code migration for UCD 6.2.2? Kindly let me know gokulknewt
293759724 @spyndi, 
I've been looking at UCD 6.2.1 API but I don't see anything obvious and ""elegant"" that would return inventory and compliance information. 
 
The only thing I found that is close to what we need is ApplicationProcessRequest resource, it returns the deployment information containing deployment status, component version and environment, but the problem is in getting ApplicationProcessRequest ID in the first place. I couldn't find a way to get it.

Did anyone find better solution? Please share your idea(s).

Thanks,

295298802 @gokulknewt @git4giri @vvigreen981 

Sorry, just got back from my vacation. I don't have any additional updates on the progress.

I'm finding it bit challenging to retrofit UDeploy 6.2.2 API to accommodate the existing Hygieia Udeploy Collector code/process flow. It appears, we may need to completely re-design/re-engineer the Udeploy collector to support Udeploy API 6.2.2.

I have also reached out to Topo @tabladrum  and Satish @satishc1 for some directions as they are the original authors on this collector.

Victor - It looks like you also reviewed the 6.2.2 API. Are you available to discuss the flow/share your findings and brain storm on an approach?

Thank you.

Hi Topo,
Recently I updated the code and built the packages. Started the dashboard as per below step.

1. Started api layer using java jar command
2. Started UI layer using gulp command.

 Hi Topo
Recently I have updated the code with latest git pull. Tried to rebuild the Jenkins Hygieia Publisher plugin. its failing with the compilation ERROR as below screen shot.
I am building it with maven 3.3.9 and Jdk 1.8

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3480342/21794505/d703acf2-d720-11e6-819e-7d07f311debc.png)

I have freshly pulled the latest code, cleared the maven cache and build the package. I am able to build all the components.
Step 1:Generated a new hygieia-publisher plugin file (.hpi), uploaded the same under Jenkins manage plugin option.
Step 2: Create a testingNew jenkins job with basic configuration (without post build action of Hygieia publisher), the jenkins job build is success
Step 3: updated the testingNew jenkins job and included post build action Hygieiapublisher and triggered the build.
Result: My jenkins job is going into infite loop and doesnot show anything in jenkins Console. It requires me to manually kill the particular job in order to terminate the job.
this happens only when I am enabling post build action fr hygieia publisher.
Below are the screen shot for configuration and log.

273217845 Can you uninstall the plugin and run the job and see if it builds okay?
never mind - I see that without the post build action, your job runs fine. tabladrum
273267495 @Mahendra1260 I've tried several permutations but I'm unable to recreate the issue u are having. 
And I'm assuming you have configured the Hygieia Server URL under 
Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Hygieia Publisher Settings
If you are on https://gitter.im/capitalone/Hygieia send me a message and we can setup a time to do a conf call if you wish. satishc1
273387345 @satishc1 @tabladrum 
yes, I have configured Hygieia Server URL and tested the connection as well. It is success..
Yes, I am there on gitter, let me ping you there too..
Meanwhile, let me try other permutation by uninstalling and try installing the old hygieia plugin to see if I face this issue only with new one or what. Mahendra1260
273886066 @satishc1 @MarkRx @tabladrum 
Thanks a lot Satish for your time and helping me to resolve the issue over the call.
Appreciate your effort..
Hence, closing the issue Mahendra1260

Also, when I am trying to publish the deployment data with the previous build .hpi, it thows the exception as below Jenkins log

 Mahendra1260
271573184 Try clearing your maven cache then rebuilding the core layer. Double check that it is installed correctly. Check the maven file in the jenkins publisher to see if it is pulling it in. MarkRx
271613422 Let me try doing it as mentioned. Mahendra1260
271680983 @MarkRx 
I deleted the cache and rebuilt core, which generated core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar. 
While trying to build publisher plugin, it threw a dependency error as pom.xml for hygieia-publisher file has  dependency mentioned for core-2.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar.
As this: 
_<dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>2.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>_

**I feel it should be** 
_<dependency>
            <groupId>com.capitalone.dashboard</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>2.0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>_

then only a fresh hpi plugin can be build successfully.
 Mahendra1260
271681166 Closed it by mistake Mahendra1260
271700350 Yes it should. @amitmawkin @tabladrum why isn't the jenkins plugin part of the travis build? MarkRx
271807802 @MarkRx @tabladrum 
I have rebuilt the core package and new version of hygie-publisher plugin. Still while running the Jenkins job where I am using post build action to deploy build and deployment status to Hygieia Dashboard, it fails with below error:

271985524 @Mahendra1260  - Have you made any changes to Repository package ? nireeshT
272076336 @nireeshT : Which repository package you are talking about?  Mahendra1260
272174971 Do you have a jenkins job with a lot of folders? Perhaps try increasing the stack size. Otherwise it could be getting stuck in an infinite loop. MarkRx
272373612 
@MarkRx 
No, the Jenkins job is a plain testing job with simple echo statement. All i am doing is just publishing the dummy deployment data.
I runs well without the Hygieia publisher plugin but the moment configure Hygieia Publisher plugin as post build action, it starts throwing the Stack OverFlow ERROR.
Seems something to do with Hygiaia publisher plugin Mahendra1260
272460170 @tabladrum @satishc1 could be related to that recursion that was added MarkRx
272475551 @Mahendra1260 Did you rebuild the api module with the latest codebase ? Since the codebase has been updated, you will need to update all your modules.. ui , api. satishc1
272773323 @satishc1 
Yes, I have rebuild it entire codebase and its is running all on 2.0.5-SNAPSHOT. I have also regenerated the hygieia-publisher hpi file and uplaoded it into Jenkins plugin.
I am observing this issue after I updated to latest code Mahendra1260
272792922 @satishc1 
Recently started seeing this error message

```
Hygieia: Failed Publishing Build Complete Data. Response Code: 500. Response Value= {timestamp:1484552466922,status:500,error:Internal Server Error,exception:java.lang.OutOfMemoryError,message:Java heap space,path:/api/build}
```

Dont know why it only happens when I configure post build action as Hygieia publisher? Mahendra1260
273027682 @satishc1 @tabladrum 
My observations

Case1: When I have created a pipeline job in Jenkins 2.x and trying to publish the build status and deployment data.
Jenkins Console Output: 
```
[Pipeline] hygieiaDeployPublishStep
Hygieia: Published Build Data For Deployment Publishing. Response Code: 201. Response Value= 587dacdaf271872ea74f5c2e
```
but, nowhere I am able to see the data on Dashboard, where and under which widget I can see the deployment data if it is success??
Also, Jenkins collector always shows the above build as Green success even though the build fails

Case 2: When i am creating the normal free style job on Jenkins2.x and using post build action for hygieia plugin, gets the below error always
Jenkins console: 
```
Finished Calculation of disk usage of workspace in 0 seconds
Hygieia: Failed Publishing Build Complete Data. Response Code: 500. Response Value= {timestamp:1484628987868,status:500,error:Internal Server Error,exception:java.lang.StackOverflowError,message:No message available,path:/api/build}
``` Mahendra1260
273213862 @MarkRx @satishc1 
I have freshly pulled the latest code, cleared the maven cache and build the package. I am able to build all the components.
Step 1:Generated a new hygieia-publisher plugin file (.hpi), uploaded the same under Jenkins manage plugin option.
Step 2: Create a testingNew jenkins job with basic configuration (without post build action of Hygieia publisher), the jenkins job build is success
Step 3: updated the testingNew jenkins job and included post build action Hygieiapublisher and triggered the build.
Result: My jenkins job is going into infite loop and doesnot show anything in jenkins Console. It requires me to manually kill the particular job in order to terminate the job.
this happens only when I am enabling post build action fr hygieia publisher.
Below are the screen shot for configuration and log.

 Mahendra1260
273217845 Can you uninstall the plugin and run the job and see if it builds okay?
never mind - I see that without the post build action, your job runs fine. tabladrum
273267495 @Mahendra1260 I've tried several permutations but I'm unable to recreate the issue u are having. 
And I'm assuming you have configured the Hygieia Server URL under 
Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Hygieia Publisher Settings
If you are on https://gitter.im/capitalone/Hygieia send me a message and we can setup a time to do a conf call if you wish. satishc1
273387345 @satishc1 @tabladrum 
yes, I have configured Hygieia Server URL and tested the connection as well. It is success..
Yes, I am there on gitter, let me ping you there too..
Meanwhile, let me try other permutation by uninstalling and try installing the old hygieia plugin to see if I face this issue only with new one or what. Mahendra1260
273886066 @satishc1 @MarkRx @tabladrum 
Thanks a lot Satish for your time and helping me to resolve the issue over the call.
Appreciate your effort..
Hence, closing the issue Mahendra1260

[],"Hi,

I am trying to setup the dashboard. I have built all the jar files. Below are the steps which i have done. 

1. Started Mongo DB
2. Started API
3. Started Jenkins Collector
4. Started UI

I was able to create a user and login to the User in the UI. I have created my own project/team dashboard. When i create one, its not getting reflecting back in the UI. The dashboard name is inserted into the DB though. Not able to see the dashboard names even if restart the UI.

What am i missing here ?

As per my understanding of the documentation, once i start all the above(DB,API,Collector and UI), i should be able to see the Jenkins information in the dashboard. 
What am i missing here? as i dont see any information or details about Jenkins in the dashboard. I am not sure if the Jenkins collector is talking to the API and API is passing on the information to the dashboard.

- Yes
Do you see your Jenkins job in the drop down?
- No roshanvc
271635166 @roshanvc - You see any errors in collector log? if yes, share the error log. Alternately check if collector is persisting Jenkins info to Mongo.   nireeshT

@rob-miller-777  MarkRx
271295343 Correct @MarkRx, we will be making admin a ""role"", so you can have multiple admin accounts.  We do not intend on adding functionality to add new admins with #1031 however, we felt that was beyond the scope of the pull request.  We just wanted to get it back to the current state with backend security.  We did lay the groundwork to make it possible though.   rob-miller-777

[],"I got following error after I started Bitbucket collector.  I noticed that both Projects and Pepos are missing in the URL http://mycompany.com/rest/api/1.0/projects//repos//commits?until=Develop&limit=25.  When configuring the Code Repo widget, only Repo URL and Branch are required, I also gave my credentials for the code repo in this case.  

Did I miss something?  Do I need modify the collector code DefaultBitbucketServerClient?
Thanks for any help.

Thank you very much for the help!

That was the problem!
When I configured the Code Repo widget, Code Repo's host was used.  
After changed to Code Repo's URL and with Credentials, now I got both project and repo displayed.
    
I tried both in the Code Repo Widget
    http://mylogin@mybitbucketrepo.com/scm/ABC/XYZ.git	
    http://mybitbucketrepo.com/scm/ABC/XYZ.git	
However, I still get error as show below the property file.

271342061 What version is your bitbucket server? Is it behind a proxy?

Hit this url in a browser:

271356686 My Bitbucket server uses Atlassian Bitbucket v4.2.0.  Is it behind a proxy?  I need find it later. 

Also, I found the branch name should be develop (lowercase), instead of Develop.
However, when I directly hit URL http://mybitbucketrepo.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/ABC/repos/XYZ/commits?until=develop&limit=25, I got 
Unable to open http://mybitbucketrepo.com/rest/api/1.0/projects/ABC/repos/XYZ/commits?until=develop&limit=25.  Cannot download the information you requested.

If I copy the URL to browser, I can get all the data.

After I reconfigured Code Repo widget with correct Branch name, now collector has no error anymore, but just stuck there:

271336822 Here is my Bamboo property file:
```properties
dbname=dashboard
dbusername=dashboarduser
dbpassword=dashboarduser
dbhost=localhost
dbport=27017
dbreplicaset=false
dbhostport=localhost:27017
server.contextPath=/api
server.port=8080
bamboo.cron=0 0/5 * * * *
bamboo.servers[0]=http://bamboo.mycompany.com
bamboo.username=myusername
bamboo.apiKey=mypassword
bamboo.saveLog=true
``` zenglincui
272922936 This issue seems related to user credentials.  Anyone has a clue how to configure?

Here is what I found:
If I try to access http://bamboo.mycompay.com/rest/api/latest/result/ABC-DEV/1867 from browser, it fails.  
When this happens, I need go to http://bamboo.mycompay.com, and login.  After login, I am able to access from browser and get all data for http://bamboo.mycompay.com/rest/api/latest/result/ABC-DEV/1867. zenglincui
276017943 I am also getting the same error. Have the same content in the application properties file as mentioned in the thread above. 
I tried accessing the URL in browser and able to see content of the URL without logging into Bamboo. Even curl <URL> is returning the content without any error.

What configuration are we missing?

278418454 Can anyone help me here?
here are my log file, looks like slimier kind of errors,

and if i try same build plan on browser i am getting this,

279604215 @Ramesh18190 : I was able to get through this yesterday. I suspect this error is due permissions issue. I am not getting this error now when I used a different user credentials. Does the user with which you are connecting to bamboo have admin privileges? roshanvc
279604909 @roshanvc Yes, I am connecting with admin privileges, but 404 not found is not for authentication right. 
I am giving  ""bamboo.apiKey=mypassword"", is this right or do we to generate apiKey?, if yes, please help how can I generate that? Ramesh18190
279606026 Yes, that is the right way. I have also given password in the same way roshanvc
283079033 I did not try this for long time until yesterday.  However, I still have problem to get the Bamboo flowing to the dashboard.  From the log I can the connector seems reading from Bamboo with:
2017-02-27 08:25:11,346 INFO  c.c.d.collector.DefaultBambooClient - Entered each build for nested plan : NG-DEV2037

...

In dashboard if open the Configure Build Widget, I can see it lists all the jobs, like
Bamboo-EP-EMBS
Bamboo-EP-EWA
...

After I select any one job, the log will show parsing error for the selected one.  For example, if I Bamboo-EP-EWA, the log shows:

i think maybe have mistakes in properties file,but i cannot find it.
thanks a lot.

another problem:
in UI page,
![widget](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23702384/21756426/3e11dc18-d65c-11e6-8424-025c036d34f0.png)

when click save button,no reponse in browser and no print in console, in browser console,i found that
```

277576648 Hi, I got the same issue and see the #957, but still not found the point. podormeijia
279837315 @taozi34 @guanzhongpeng Try with the lastest codebase. Run the gitlab collector once before trying to save the UI config. If your gitlab host uses https, import the cert into the jvm that's running your gitlab collector.

The only properties you need for gitlab are:
```
dbname=yourdbname
dbhost=yourdbhost
dbport=27017

276754643 @Mpluya Thanks for the contribution. Can you please add a screenshot and some details on how the UI looks with this change? If you search for something in the ui select dropdown, and if it returns the first 20 hits, is there a next (prev) button for the user to select and look through the results ? satishc1
276963572 @satishc1 below is a screenshot of how configuring jenkins or sonar looks like with this enhancement. 

The way we (@rob-miller-777 and I) have it configured is:

- on click to the search field without typing anything, it will send a server side request without any search criteria but the size of 20 
`api/collector/item/type/build?size=20`
- with the screenshot I provided below I typed in 'BusinessLine' as a search criteria. As I was typing this, the following server side requests were made:
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=Busines&size=20`
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=Business&size=20`
`api/collector/item/type/build?search=BusinessLine&size=20`
  This is so, because we've configured the search text field with a 250 ms of typeahead-wait-ms. Typeahead-wait-ms (from angular docs) is the minimal wait time after last character typed before typeahead kicks-in.

The idea is for users to type in what they are searching for and if the result they are looking for doesn't show up on the first 20 results, continue to refine the results by typing more.

Let me know if you need further details. Thanks.

277287732 @Mpluya @rob-miller-777 @mdskd @tabladrum Thanks for the screenshot and the details. If the results are being paginated, there should be a prev and next button to browse the ""pages"". The user will not know why their ""desired"" result is not showing up in the first 20 or whatever number we set. While this is a great feature we really need it, can you explore the possibility of adding a way to browse through the search results ? Your thoughts ? satishc1
277299120 Yeah, I think it could benefit from some sort of infinite scroll.  I think we had looked into that, but finding a library that could handle the filtering and infinite scroll was challenging.  We could take a look again however.   rob-miller-777
277325841 agree with comments that some sort of paging in the ui would be good - infinite scroll fits more in this particular scenario from a ui design perspective.


Let take a look at this next week @rob-miller-777 mdavis40
278082914 @satishc1 @tabladrum We have been trying a few different things to utilize pagination.  Our first attempt was to add infinite scroll to the UIB-Typeahead directive.  This doesn't seem to be possible without either modifying the source code for the typeahead directive, or creating our own.  Neither of which seem ideal to us.  We also couldn't find any existing libraries that combine infinite scroll/pagination and filtering in a select dialog.  We are currently trying a different approach by adding a table/list of ""jobs"" to the form, and server side pagination and filtering on top of that.  The functionality is much easier to implement for this, however the user experience suffers a little bit as it takes up more of the screen, and there are more buttons to click for navigating.  So the two options we are looking at right now are keeping the functionality as is in this merge request, where to find your job, you have to continue to type your job name until it appears in the list.  Or we can add the table with filtering and pagination.  We will submit a merge request with the second option when ready. rob-miller-777
278103097 @rob-miller-777 @tabladrum  If the UIB-typeahead paginated scrolling is tough to implement, then given a choice between the 2 options, I would pick option 1. We can have a quick conference call if you have some time available. We are on gitter.im, if you wanna ping me at a convenient time. Thanks for researching this. satishc1

Here is what option 2 could look like.  Could make some small tweaks, but something along these lines.  I don't think I'll be able to use gitter.im right now since it hasn't been approved here for business use.  So for the time being, would you mind just communicating here?
 rob-miller-777
278136610 Just to be clear on the two options. 

1. Functions as is in this current merge request.  No pagination.  Have to type in the name of your job until it appears.

2. List of jobs which can be filtered and paginated through an input box and pagination directive. 

Pictures of both above.  rob-miller-777
278138459 @rob-miller-777 Looking at the screenshot for Option 2, I think Option 1 is definitely easier to use. Let me pull the PR down and play around with it a little more. At the moment i'm tending towards merging the PR as is. Let me discuss it internally here and i'll let u know soon. Thanks again for your team's effort on this. We truly appreciate the collaboration. satishc1
278138954 Sounds good, appreciate the feedback.  If you want to play around with option 2, let me know and I can get a branch out there.  Still needs some clean up, but functions properly.  rob-miller-777

[],"We ran into a scenario where one of our users created a dashboard with a slash ('/') in the name, i.e. ""Test/Dashboard"". While dashboard creation was successful, he then was unable to configure any of the widgets. This is so because the configure action was unable to hit the '/dashboard/myowner/{dashboardtitle}' endpoint, since his request was '/dashboard/myowner/Test/Dashboard'. My question to the group is, would there be interest in adding a validation around the dashboard name to prevent slashes and or any special characters? If yes, I'll open a PR on this.
